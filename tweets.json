  "2025-12-22|THE REAL VALUE OF AMERICAN REAL ESTATE  Molson ask": {
    "id": "2003104844081778741",
    "fullText": "THE REAL VALUE OF AMERICAN REAL ESTATE\n\nMolson asks: what's safe when fiat fails? A great question. We unfortunately have more films on alien invasions and killer robots than we do on fiat failures, so relatively few have thought through this scenario. But given that decades of accumulated borrowing is now finally coming due, it's worth modeling what happens when the dollar is debased to pay the unpayable debts:\n\nWe'll focus on the question of whether real estate is really safe in the event of an American fiat crisis, but many of the concepts apply broadly to any G7 country in the midst of sovereign debt crisis.\n\n(1) First, the conventional wisdom is that gold, guns, and land are reliably valuable in a US fiat crisis. I'm not so sure. Gold can be stopped at TSA metal detectors. Guns are only truly useful when the state fails, in genuine Mad Max scenarios. And real estate is really not very safe in a failed state.\n\n(2) To emphasize that last point: in Soviet Russia or Maoist China or Kleptocrat California, real estate is really not very safe. All the homeless encampments, illegal aliens, anti-building regulations, and squatter laws in places like California have eroded property rights. Billions of dollars in real estate lies fallow as a consequence. Add to that the corruption of a failed state that takes infinite taxes but can't stop endless fires, and you get the Pacific Palisades. Worth billions on paper, burned to the ground in practice:\n\n(3) Much Blue American real estate is like that. Are you really bullish on New York City real estate in real terms, given its current leadership? Or Seattle, Portland, Chicago, LA, or Boston? The one thing keeping some of those economies afloat is tech money. But of course the governments of those places also want that tech money out.\n\n(4) Moreover, there are good reasons to think real estate should depreciate in real terms. For one thing, the Case-Shiller index shows America to be at the top of a nominal real estate bubble even more insane than the 2008 crisis:\n\n(5) For another thing, US real estate actually has been dropping in real terms, which is to say against a basket of Internet currencies and Internet companies:\n\n(6) For a third thing, there are also significant forces (YIMBYism and the like) which want to bring real estate prices down for good reasons, by making housing more affordable by building more. This is distinct from reducing real estate prices for bad reasons, by allowing it to become uninhabitable as per the Palisades. And it's also distinct from reducing real estate demand by simply reducing the number of people emigrating to the US, which is the policy of the right. But all of those forces (libertarian, left, and right) want to bring the real price of real estate down.\n\n(7) And that's a good thing, right? I mean...yes, in theory. But it does mean real estate may not be a good long-term store of value in an American fiat crisis, which was @Molson_Hart's original question. Neither gold (hard to transport), nor guns (only useful in Mad Max), nor US land may have that much real value in the long run. Particularly as the chaos we see online spills offline. Think the Pacific Palisades, but everywhere.\n\n(8) And there is another wrinkle. Powerful factions (NIMBYs, boomers) do not want US real estate to go down in real terms. They want number-go-up technology applied to their house, their ostensible store of value. And like every American, they're suffering from inflation, which is boosting their property taxes without actually increasing their resale value.\n\n(9) So the compromise \"solution\" may be that the nominal value of real estate goes up (via money printing) while the real value of the dollar goes down. The boomers get a high number on their house but no real value; the rest get not even that. And American real estate thus becomes more affordable if (and only if) you're outside the rapidly inflating dollar economy, by living in other countries or holding only hard currencies.\n\n(10) That is an unfortunate forecast, but very similar to what happened in Russia in the 90s after the end of the Soviet Empire. Very little within the Russian system was really safe. Safety came from getting outside the system, from exiting the failing system.",

This is not the posture of a republic that just wanted to sit meekly behind its borders, as today\u2019s American right often claims.\n\nNor is it really a democracy, as the American left would have it.

    "id": "1999334732904169707",
    "fullText": "How did the left go from pro-tech communists to anti-tech primitivists? Three theses.\n\n(1) Tech redecentralized. Communism replaces G-o-d with G-o-v, putting the centralized state above all. And 20th century tech was centralized, while 21st century tech is centralized. Think mass production and mass media vs smartphone/cryptocurrency/internet. And because the centralized state has less power over the decentralized network, the statist far left hates the network, and by extension tech.\n\n(2) Tech remarried capitalism. In the Soviet Union, thought control extended to all areas of life except science, engineering, and mathematics. Logical reasoning was forbidden except in STEM. So, the very best Soviets poured all their energies into math and science, which were individual accomplishments, as opposed to capitalism and business, which were managerial accomplishments. Tech and capitalism were separated in the USSR.\n\nMeanwhile, the postwar America had 90% marginal tax rates and it was very challenging to start a business during the period of William Whyte's Organization Man. In the US, tech talent went into academia thanks to the Vannevar Bush centralization of STEM. So, tech and capitalism were also partially separated in the USA. That era's Elon would have been compelled to join NASA, and been unable to start SpaceX.\n\nHowever, the peak of centralized government tech created the transistor, and then Fairchild Semiconductor and DEC. And thus did decentralization begin, and the remarriage of tech with capitalism.\n\n(3) Tech became associated with an enemy tribe. In the 1960s, parts of the Western left swapped out the working class for the wokest class. The white working man they used to hold up as the noble victim of the evil capitalists turned overnight into the rayyycist Archie Bunker. This was much like the Sino-Soviet split, but unannounced.\n\nIt was a complicated dynamic where the Western left started to go in a more deconstructionist direction, as a way to get creative independence from the Soviet left, much like the Chinese communists went in an agrarian direction to get away from the Marxism of the Soviet communists. It's been reported that this was partially CIA-sponsored, as the decentralized left of abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock was preferred to the centralized left of the Soviets.\n\nAnyway, as a consequence, for the Western left tech became gradually associated with their enemy tribe of whites/males. That was different from the enemy tribe of the Soviet left. The Soviets thought math would help them triumph over the capitalists, while the wokes think math is itself white and male.",

This is why anti-tech will unfortunately have wide appeal\u2026it has certain premises that may seem to make sense, but which are often taken to insane conclusions (like the Unabomber).\n\n\u201cLeftists are oversocialized\u2026therefore I must live in the jungle like an animal\u201d\n\nReally, the fundamental error that Kacynszki made is thinking of technological progress as being \u201cunnatural\u201d rather than the essence of being human. The main thing that distinguishes man from animal is technology. We evolved over millennia to use spears rather than fangs, and to wear clothes rather than fur,  and to use fire rather than digestive enzymes. Technological progress accompanied greater levels of encephalization.\n\nKaczynski\u2019s remedy for someone feeling cooped up in a cubicle was to make them live like an animal, which is like Marx fixing a worker\u2019s labor conditions by sending them to the gulag.\n\nRecall also: Marx appealed to the feeling that capitalism was disrupting farms, artisans, and the working man. \u201cAll that is solid melts into air.\u201d He was against disruption, of the creative variety at least. He only wanted murderous revolution followed by economic stasis, which he got.\n\nBecause in practice communism is ultra-conservative, in the sense that it freezes the current technological time period in place.

Possibly murderously worse.\n\nSo: Indian immigrant technocapitalists need alternatives. And there are three options: India, Internet, and International.\n\n1. India \nIndia itself is the world's fastest growing economy, with the #1 growth rate in the world over the last 10 years. Every major company is investing in India. So you can do well in the Indian economy:\n\n2. Internet\nThe Internet is taking over from a fading NYSE/NASDAQ as the world's largest capital market. The decline of Delaware and NYC accelerate this; everyone from Elon to Elad Gil to a16z to Dropbox have moved out of Delaware for incorporation, and Mamdani is catalyzing a capital exodus to Miami.\n\nSo: the US is no longer a stable place for capital formation. And Solana and Ethereum already put Indians on a level playing field with the entire world, with digital rule-of-law. No one can discriminate against you in a smart contract simply for being Indian, so you can do well in the Internet economy:\n\n3. International\nFinally, at the exact moment that the US has stopped recruiting tech talent while India is generating enormous amounts of it, the rest of the world is opening their doors to digital nomads.\n\nDozens of places from the UAE to Singapore have created many different kinds of talent visas. And so Indian technologists have begun rerouting there, especially to Dubai and Singapore. So that's the third option: the International economy:\n\nIn short: do not expect the US to suddenly become more friendly towards immigrant capitalists. The long-term financial outlook is not good, so America is unfortunately no longer a good place to build a stable life and a career. Which is why Americans themselves are in a zero-sum mentality.\n\nYou can't fix that.\n\nInstead, if you're an Indian technologist, rely only on TCP/IP rather than H-1B. And build yourself up in India, on the Internet, or internationally.",

    "id": "1996672131506262424",
    "fullText": "Fundamentals over founderitis.\n\nA few decades ago, the concept of becoming a tech founder wasn\u2019t even understood as something you could do. In the 80s and the early 90s, you saw businessmen on TV, but there was no well-understood playbook for starting a company. Kids were encouraged to graduate and get a salary-paying job.\n\nThis started to change by the mid/late 2000s. And since then, the Internet has done a good job of encouraging entrepreneurship. Perhaps too good. Perhaps we\u2019ve overcorrected. Perhaps we have to start discouraging it, or at least start injecting a note of realism.\n\nBecause I see far too many people these days who are simply unrealistic in their personal ambitions.\n\nI mean, if you can do the technical equivalent of dunking from the free throw line, and if you also have exceptional pain tolerance, and if you\u2019re truly driven to build something you can\u2019t buy, sure, you can try founding. But otherwise you are likely better off getting a stable job.\n\nThe related issue is that the last ten years of wokeness, COVID, and now AI have led to a pipeline problem in education\u2026where basic fundamentals are lacking in young people that nevertheless have a stated ambition to do high tech.\n\nEssentially: too many are interested in \u201ctech\u201d (by which they mean money) but they aren\u2019t interested in tech (by which I mean math). \n\nThey do a cargo cult thing where they copy the superficial characteristics of famous entrepreneurs (like meditation retreats, or wearing hoodies, or what have you) without copying the substantive characteristics (like years of heads-down technical study).\n\nAnyway, I think we need to stress realism more, and fundamentals far more. Need to walk before you run, and run before you fly, and many will never fly, and that\u2019s ok too.",

    "fullText": "For years, the conventional wisdom was to put 100% of your energy into building, and to ignore politics.\n\nThe problem was that those who put 100% of their energy into fighting, particularly politicians, would then take everything you\u2019d built.\n\nLike the video game Civilization. If you put everything into science and commerce, while the next door tribe puts it all into swordsmen and slogans, they\u2019ll waltz over and walk over you.\n\nThe temptation is then to respond in kind, by putting 100% of your resources into fighting. This does work to ward off the initial assault. But without building you become just like your violent and unproductive neighbors. Everyone becomes a violent, dumb tribesman. And technological progress grinds to a halt.\n\nThis is the downward spiral that characterizes the darkest ages of history.\n\nIndeed, perhaps some day, long in the past, that violent neighboring tribe that\u2019s trying to steal from you once fell into a similar downward spiral thanks to *their* enemies. And lost their productive capacity, and had only tribal raiding to fall back on, resulting in their current state of contagious degradation. Think Planet of the Apes.\n\nThere is an answer, though. It\u2019s 70% build, 20% write, and 10% fight. Put most energy into building, some energy into writing, and one tenth towards fighting.\n\nThink of the 10% like your defense budget. Your technological progress provides the capital and growth to fund defense. Indeed, you may end up with >10X the resources of the vicious neighboring tribes. Because they focus solely on demonizing others rather than building up themselves. And if so, 10% of your resources will match 100% of theirs.\n\nThen, even by devoting 100% of their energy to fighting, they won\u2019t be able to steal. Your defense is too strong. So they\u2019ll simply need to build their own stuff. As will other tribes. Now everyone gets wealthier, and has less reason to fight.\n\nAnd this is the upward spiral.",

    "id": "1991434620978753952",
    "fullText": "NO PUBLIC UNDISCLOSED AI\nThat's my new heuristic after the last few years of seeing AI in practice. \n\nAs context, there's a Laffer curve[a] for AI. The optimal amount of AI in most things is not 100% nor 0%. Because if you use 0% AI, it's slow, but if you rely on 100% AI, it's slop. The exact number is situational. But just knowing it's not 100% or 0% is actually a useful heuristic. \n\nThat said, a few hard-and-fast rules are useful. So here they are:\n\n(1) Rule 1: don't use AI-generated text in public.\nDon't use AI-generated text in outbound emails, in DMs, or on websites. Because AI text is the new lorem ipsum, namely lorem aipsum. It's fine as a placeholder, for a prototype, but if you actually use it in production it's just verbose and cliche-ridden. It signals that you haven't actually put any thought into what you're writing.\n\n(2) Rule 2: don't use undisclosed AI imagery.\nBe cautious about how and where you use AI-generated images or videos, particularly ones where you haven't carefully fine-tuned the prompt. I didn't pattern match this until this year, because the tech is quite new, but by 2025 whenever I see slides with low quality AI-generated imagery, I think \"ok, that's probably fake.\"\n\nYou can still use AI imagery in prototypes, in fictional movies, or in graphic design contexts where it's obviously AI. And you can also use a lot of prompting with a tool like Midjourney to get high quality AI imagery that genuinely illustrates what's in your mind's eye.\n\nBut, roughly, it's garbage-in, garbage out. If you didn't put a ton of effort into your AI images, if you didn't add a lot of information with your highly specific prompts and do many reps to pick the best one, the result will be obviously bad (and fake).\n\n(3) Rule 3: AI is fine in private, but disclose in public.\nYou can use AI to research things or prototype things for your team or yourself, where it's obvious that what you're getting back is AI. However, be very cautious about using it in public without disclosure. \n\nAgain, if I get a message that has obvious AI text in it, I think the sender is either lazy, or can't write, or has low reading comprehension, or hasn't put any thought into what they're asking about, or all of the above. Ironically, it signals the opposite of what early adoption normally signals! AI text in communications actually indicates low intelligence, or at least a total lack of savvy, rather than artificially high intelligence.\n\nIf you put that together, it's a short rule: \"no public undisclosed AI.\"\n\n(a) So you can use AI in private without disclosing, because it's just search results or raw data analysis for your team to review.\n\n(b) And you can use AI in public, with disclosure. And that disclosure could sometimes simply be the context, where it's an obviously fictional video or labeled a prototype.\n\n(c) And you have a more sophisticated rule than simply saying \"no AI\", which is highly suboptimal because 0% AI is slow in many contexts.\n\nWhat you just shouldn't do is use AI publicly (which includes cold emails or DMs) without disclosing it. This is in your interests as well, because by disclosing it the other party knows you aren't trying to pass off a quick AI search result or AI prototype as the real thing.",

For example, the market for (say) email has been made worse by AI slop.\n\nPolite disclosure is one way to control verification costs; \u201coh yeah, that\u2019s just an AI result, but take a look it\u2019s a prototype.\u201d\n\nImpolite identification is another: \u201cthis message was obviously AI spam, so don\u2019t send any more.\u201d\n\nAnd AI tools to detect use of AI tools will be yet another mechanism to control verification costs.",

    "fullText": "There\u2019s an alternate history where Russia didn\u2019t go communist.\n\nIn 1911, a man named Pyotr Stolypin was Prime Minister of Russia. Staunchly anti-war and traditionalist, he was nevertheless also an energetic reformer. He suppressed violent revolutionaries, but gave peasants their own land to farm. He was the path to a peaceful capitalist reformation in Russia. Lenin hated him, and called him the hangman-in-chief.\n\nThen he was assassinated. Historians still debate whether it was a conspiracy or a lone gunman. But three years later, Russia entered the kind of war Stolypin opposed. Six years later, it fell to Bolshevik revolution. Ten years later, Lenin and Trotsky emerged triumphant in the Russian Civil War. And then a century of communist mass murder began.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that the infighting on the American right seems to have exploded after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. That one young man was evidently the unseen linchpin keeping a fractious coalition together.\n\nI say this not to be a doomer, but to point out that the future isn\u2019t necessarily written. Much can hinge on the efforts of one man. Had Lenin been shot, the future might have been different. Instead, it was Stolypin.\nhttps://t.co/feWn1WdTUT",

I understand how that ideology arose, but it actually makes you weak, because it inhibits scaled cooperation.\n\nEssentially: in almost every context in life you can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be the leader. Even Elon isn\u2019t running the water supply or sewing his own clothes. In those contexts, he\u2019s just an individual like any other, operating in a context where he isn\u2019t the boss. Even the greatest CEO of all time can\u2019t be CEO of everything, all the time.\n\nSteve Jobs understood this too. Also a superalpha at Apple, he nevertheless understood in an email towards the end of his life (attached below) how dependent he was on the rest of humanity in most other contexts.\n\nWhat few understand is that being a leader is actually a huge responsibility. You simply can\u2019t be at the top of every hierarchy in the world nor should you seek to be. A good life is more about win/win cooperation than the quixotic pursuit of zero-sum dominance. The fact that Western societies have lost faith in both God and the State is part of what\u2019s driven them towards the most primitive sort of chest-thumping Internet he-manism, but being \u201calpha\u201d all the time doesn\u2019t scale.\n\nCooperation does.",

There are many different ways to not be a member of the Democrat Party.\n\n* Wokeness hasn\u2019t been defeated, but woke hegemony over the Anglosphere discourse has been defeated, for now at least. It\u2019s like the fall of communism; the North Korean and Cuban regimes do continue to the present day even though Bolshevism/Stalinism no longer has pull.\n\n** The concept of an \u201cAmerican nationalist\u201d is less coherent than the post-Soviet Russian nationalist. Russians were down to 51% of the USSR by the end, but WASPs are down to <20% of the US. And many of those WASPs are of course on the far left, like Elizabeth Warren.

    "fullText": "(1) The fundamental issue is that 1950-1990 was not the normal way things are supposed to be, but actually an extraordinarily unusual period historically. That was peak Westernization and peak centralization:\n\n(2) As the center of mass of the world economy returns to Eurasia, where it was for thousands of years, the relative strength of the West has declined.\n\n(3) In isolation this wouldn't necessarily be bad, as a decline in relative terms could still of course be combined with an ascent in absolute terms. It's possible for your economy to prosper even if other economies have become bigger.\n\n(4) The problem arises because the West's living standards are entirely dependent upon continued absolute dominance, because it's propped up by the issuance of the global reserve currency, namely the dollar. It is only because Vietnamese factory workers accept digital dollars for physical shoes that US living standards are what they are.\n\n(5) So the US can't tolerate a gradual decline to #2 status. As it descends from the undisputed #1 position, the tax base for dollar inflation contracts from at least 1-3B globally to maybe 300M Americans. A 60-90% drop in tax base of this kind will radically increase inflation, as fewer people will shoulder more printing.\n\n(6) And these issues are shared across the entire G7. It's not just the US. We see France and the UK talking about IMF bailouts. But of course, who'll then bail out the IMF? Because we see soaring yields across the US, France, UK, Italy, Germany, and Japan at the same time, even as Chinese yields are falling:\n\n(7) So, at a global macro level, market participants are selling Western bonds and buying Chinese bonds, gold, internet stocks, and internet currencies. The 20th century Western economy is being retired and its successors are China and the Internet, the land and the cloud respectively.\n\n(8) To mix metaphors, this cake is already baked, but it hasn't been marked to market, so look out below. Everyone knows Western governments are bankrupt, just like everyone knew Biden was senile, but they were all in denial until it couldn't be denied.",

    "fullText": "Almost three years later, how did this play out?\n\nDue to an enormous push by e/acc and Elon and the election, the genuinely dystopian threat of centralized woke AI was fought and defeated. The establishment failed to chokepoint the technology on the basis of \u201csafety\u201d concerns.\n\nThe surprising part is that the Chinese AI and decentralized AI camps ended up overlapping, with the Chinese releasing open weights (albeit not fully open source) models. Since anyone globally can use decentralized models for any purpose, this means AI also can\u2019t get chokepointed on the basis of \u201csecurity\u201d concerns.\n\nWe still want truly open source AI, where anyone can rebuild the models from scratch to ensure there aren\u2019t any Easter Eggs in the weights. For example, we want to make sure AI-generated code from open weight models doesn\u2019t have subtle security  backdoors.\n\nNevertheless, we\u2019re in better shape overall from an AI freedom standpoint than when there was just one excellent (but closed and woke) model from one company.\n\nNow there are many excellent open models, with a range of views, from many companies. The next step is to get truly open source models.",

    "fullText": "A few thoughts:\n\n(1) How would you implement this? It\u2019s easy if the devices are pre-configured to talk to each other, like a multiple monitor setup. Then it\u2019s just a gesture recognition via cameras, on top of a copy/paste and an Airdrop. \n\n(2) Moroever, the devices would have to be pre-configured to talk to each other in *some* sense, as unless they were both logged into the same account, you could copy/paste random things into someone else\u2019s computer just by pointing at the screen.\n\n(3) So long as both devices are logged into the same online account, then all devices connected to that account just need to poll their surroundings via camera, until they capture the copy and then the paste gesture. You\u2019d have to work on the edge case if three or more logged-in devices with cameras were pointing at the user as the paste (or copy) gesture could be detected on more than one device.\n\n(4) Then: Gesture-based interaction for computers is really cool, but people get gorilla arm doing it, so it\u2019s only been a relatively niche thing, useful in video games and VR.\n\n(5) However, with the rise of physical AI, it strikes me that you should be able to not just talk to your robot companions, but gesture to them, and they\u2019ll do things. For example: point and your robot dog fetches a stick.",

But there was an insane double standard. In the physical world, the Biden admin gleefully abolished the police. Meanwhile, in the digital world they demanded that CEOs achieve impossible levels of probity.\n\nThe ethnic dimension to CZ's persecution was similarly execrable. In reality, he helped many millions of Chinese people get into Bitcoin and thereby get to freedom. And also helped millions of poor people from around the globe get out of failed currencies, and into cryptocurrency.\n\nSo he did more for practical human rights and civil liberties than most. CZ did nothing wrong, and did so many things right.\n\nOf course, my friends at Coinbase and I were competitors of Binance.

  "2025-10-21|What comes next for AI? Perhaps physically specifi": {
    "id": "1980675785397792769",
    "fullText": "What comes next for AI? Perhaps physically specific intelligence, more than artificial general intelligence.\n\nHere\u2019s a draft thesis.\n\n(1) First, AI is now entering the trough of the hype cycle. Every tech, no matter how amazing, goes through this. It\u2019s actually one of the best times to invest and build once the space begins to thin.\n\n(2) Second, AI is both highly useful for search, summarization, visualization, and prototyping *and* a highly annoying source of spam, scams, and slop. Too many will focus solely on the downsides.\n\n(3) Third, the exact plateau of AI is quite unexpected. The fact that current models seem to have topped out at \u201cfar better web search and summary\u201d is not where most would have pegged it in 2022. Disrupting Google is a historical accomplishment, yet it\u2019s not the machine god.\n\n(4) One thesis for why models plateaued in this way is that LLM-style digital AI really *is* just repeating, rather than truly thinking. It is downstream, not upstream. Now, you can get much further with this than most thought. But you can\u2019t get all the way to novel thoughts.\n\n(5) That leads to another point: as I\u2019ve said before, digital AI does it middle-to-middle, not end-to-end. Because the bottleneck for digital AI is prompting and verifying.\n\n(6) However, *physical* AI \u2014 in the sense of robotic guidance \u2014 *can* feasibly do things end-to-end, albeit after the investment of a lot of energy on edge cases. For example, self-driving cars now truly can take you from point A to point B. They do it end-to-end.\n\n(7) So, extremely well-specified and economically valuable physical world problems like \u201cdrive from point A to point B\u201d are where we should see significant AI progress. Call this physical specific intelligence.\n\n(8) Chinese robots in particular will nail task after task, in many form factors beyond just cars or humanoids. Sidewalk robots and delivery drones are already live in China, alongside self-driving cars, and their hardware sector is accelerating.\n\n(9) One reason to be more short-term\nbullish on physically specific intelligence rather than artificial general intelligence is that the physical world is real while the digital world can be fictional. @drfeifei made the related point that the textbook concept of simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) is actually an explicit physical world model, something we\u2019ve all known is lacking in the digital realm.\n\n(10) In particular, if you have N different robots all doing SLAM (or equivalent) and uploading their sensor data to a central database, they are all in a sense learning from the same physical world and each other. The millions of training miles driven by self-driving cars show that this strategy works.\n\n(11) Contrast this to the digital world. Text can be fake, it can be fictional, and indeed it is often so. And this is doubly so as AI text permeates the web.\n\n(12) So N robots sensing the physical world will converge on a consensus reality. A Unitree robot and a Tesla robot will perceive the same objects. By contrast, N agents in the digital world just keep ingesting text and images, which can and will be inconsistent.\n\n(13) In the absence of digital signatures, the online data used for AI training will be not just internally inconsistent but fake in subtle or deep ways. Indeed, widespread AI models ensure that much digital data (outside hard digital borders) will become fake, or slop, or AI agents talking to each other.\n\n(14) Algorithmic breakthroughs could obviate everything I\u2019ve just said. But at least right now, the field seems wide open for physically specific intelligence.\n\n(15) The industrial version of physically specific intelligence is factory robots. The consumer version though is a garden of intelligent things: robot cars, dogs, drones, fridges, and the like that can talk to you and understand you. Amazon Alexa, but for everything?",

  "2025-10-17|Democrats underestimated Republicans, and lost the": {
    "id": "1979124748983636344",
    "fullText": "Democrats underestimated Republicans, and lost the meme war. Republicans underestimated China, and are unfortunately losing the trade war. And some in China may underestimate the free Internet, where choice can triumph over force.\n\nThis requires some explanation. Let's go.\n\n(1) First, as a reality shill, we should stipulate that modern China is perhaps the most physically formidable country to ever exist. Visualize a young Bolo Yeung from Bloodsport. It's #1 in electricity, cars, steel, ships, and countless other industries. No country can realistically win a war against today's China, especially in its own backyard, especially over Taiwan. They can just outbuild everyone else:\n\n(2) And the US on some level now recognizes this. Secretary Hegseth noted on the Shawn Ryan pod that Chinese hypersonics can sink all US aircraft carriers in the first 20 minutes of any Taiwan straits conflict[1]. The CEO of Raytheon admitted[2] the US couldn't practically decouple from China. The former Secretary of the Navy, Carlos del Toro, stated[3] that one Chinese shipyard can produce more ships than the entire US Navy combined. And the Pentagon's own $400M study[4] showed that much of the US military is actually made in China:\n\n(3) This may be why the US is currently effecting a shouting retreat. Even as the military is rebranded to the Department of War, US troops are reportedly[5] being pulled back to actually focus on homeland defense and the war within. And even while there's posting about annexing Greenland and invading Canada, in reality European NATO is being asked to fend for itself. Basically, the words are about expanding American real estate, but the reality is that America is withdrawing from the world:\n\n(4) Now, some will say this isn't a bad thing. After all, America is a republic, not an empire! OK, but the business model of the US is money printing, which is premised on the continuation of global empire. That's because dollar inflation is global taxation, since the inflationary dilution is currently spread across billions of global dollar holders. However...as US troops come back and US tariffs go up, the de facto tax base for dollar inflation shrinks from ~1-3B globally to just 330M Americans. That 67-90% drop in tax base will cause a huge drop in American living standards. We're in the middle of this now; gold and digital gold are smashing all time highs[6], because the dollar is crashing through all-time lows.\n\n(5) Moreover, because the sovereign debt crisis is underway in America, Western Europe, and Japan at the same time, you're seeing a simultaneous fall of all parts of the empire at once. As you can see from the graphs below, yields are high in the US, Germany, Japan, UK, Italy, and France...even as they're falling in China...and even as the world economy has decisively moved to Asia:\n\n(6) So, we are essentially in the midst of the fall of Rome[7]. For the first time in 500+ years, the world's dominant military power is no longer Western. While the shift towards Europe took hundreds of years, the shift back to Asia took just a few decades. It happened so fast that many don't realize that the world economy has already moved back to Asia.\n\n(7) Many Westerners are still in various stages of denial about this fact, or the fact that the US government is insolvent. Elon is our best guy, and gave it his all, and he's already recognized[8] that it's over (\"did my best\"). But there's still residual romanticism about America's ability to re-industrialize.\n\n(8) In many ways, MAGA still identifies as a manufacturing superpower, and they just don't want to hear that it took 45+ years of grinding in factories for China to get where it is, and that 45% tariffs won't return America overnight to the economy (let alone the demographics) of 1945. There may be a post-dollar path to rebuilding, but it'd be like Russia's post-Soviet path. And the first step in that path would look more like deregulation and special economic zones[9], rather than tariffing away America's access to raw materials and machine tools.\n\n(9) Anyway, I want to skip over the dollar collapse part of all this, because it'll be an unfortunate denouement to what was once the greatest empire of all time. Let's skip ahead to the next question of: what force could possibly rise to balance China after the dollar ends?\n\n(10) Well, after the Roman Empire fell, Christianity endured, and was eventually the seed for civilizational rebirth. Similarly, after the dollar empire ends, the Internet will endure \u2014 and could be the seed for civilizational rebirth.\n\n(11) Think of the progression from European Christendom, to the West, to the Internet. Each such shift was a geographical and technological and demographic change[10]...but most of all it was a change in self-understanding.\n\n(12) We already know on some level that the Internet is the most powerful force in the world. It manages 99% of transactions and communications, it's upstream of every politician and election, it controls everything from smart locks to autonomous drones, and it's even in front of your face right now.\n\n(13) Nevertheless, because it's currently[11] intangible, the Internet is still underestimated. The Chinese state does actually get it on some level, which is why they built the Great Firewall as a hard digital border that keeps out foreign ideas (and foreign drones). But post-Maoist China doesn't really have an ideology that's built for export. Chinese nationalism does make intuitive sense to ~1.4B Chinese, so it has sufficient scale to coordinate huge numbers of productive people domestically...but the other 7B+ globally will need something else.\n\n(14) That is: China is a goods exporter, but an idea importer. After all, its three major operating systems of Buddhism, Communism, and Technocapitalism were imported from India, Europe, and America respectively. To be fair, China did fork these operating systems, and made them their own (eg: communism with Chinese characteristics), and China does have an impressive 5000+ year history of arts and literature. But for whatever reason, Chinese culture mainly exports visual vibes (eg TikTok, Hong Kong cinema, glowing cities) rather than verbal ideas.\n\n(15) So, because China doesn't export a conceptual operating system that anyone in the world can adopt and fork, there will be a post-dollar ideological vacuum that's only incompletely filled by a return to nationalism. Many need something higher than the mere earth, and the cloud is something higher. The next Rome, the next Britain, the next America, the next universalist society \u2014 that will arise from the Internet, which after all is uniform rule-of-code.\n\n(16) Finally, to @JZ281C's point...these Internet societies cannot and should not physically confront China or (as they put it) interfere in China's internal affairs. Against the Chinese drone armada, you'll still need some residual local deterrence, but the Internet will mainly need to rely on Gandhian non-violence, invisibility, agility, encryption, and decentralization. You just can't take on a superior physical force in the physical world.\n\n(17) Still, because the Internet is intangible it will be underestimated, and this underestimation is itself a strength. The invisibility of the Internet, the dismissibility of it, is the English-compatible version of hide your strength and bide your time. Despite the fact that billions spend much of their waking lives on the Internet, it's still not thought of as the primary organizing principle of their life. This underestimation gives us room for the long rebuild on Internet First[12] principles.\n\n(18) Specifically: the Internet will not be able to take on China in the physical world, but it will generate universalist ideas that appeal to many Chinese (and non-Chinese) people. It will therefore provide many alternative ideologies to Chinese nationalism outside China, whose collective strength may balance (not beat) China.\n\n(19) How does this play out? We could see a billion-person Chinese superstate, and a thousand million-person network states. If one is a vegan village and the second a carnivore community and the third is a biohacker borough, these societies are mutually incompatible with each other. Moreover, their governing ideas can't all be imported into China as their moral premises are different from Chinese nationalism. So these network states become alternatives to China, balances to China, without needing to fight China. \n\n(20) We'll know they're a balance if Chinese nationals voluntarily choose to exit to one of these 1000 startup societies, as an alternative to the 100s of polished Chinese cities. They might do this for much the same reason one chooses a startup over Google: because of the upside, the choice, the variety, the editability.\n\n(21) Yet at the same time the mere existence of these alternative societies around the world wouldn't provoke China. And China wouldn't gain from conquering them, as they'd want to avoid the expensive Roman/British/French/Soviet/American failure mode of endless military intervention. Even if it did conquer some, it couldn't really conquer one thousand, if new startup societies kept popping up every day.\n\n(22) In other words: ideas are upstream of men, code is upstream of drones, private property is private keys, and the keyboard may yet prove on par with the sword. The creation of alternative societies is one model for how the Internet may eventually balance China.",

    "id": "1979132462904271032",
    "fullText": "One thing I want to stress: this is the Flight 93 Administration.\n\nWhat that means is: many in the administration really are smart, well-intentioned men who managed to rush the cockpit against all odds, take control of the plane from abolish-the-police ideological terrorists, and are now trying to avert a crash landing. Some also do get how difficult the strategic situation vs China and the debt and so on is.\n\nBut if you look at the numbers, the plane's relative descent has been going on for decades and is now likely irreversible:\n\nEven this relative descent might not be the end of the world if the US exported tomatoes and cars. However, it mainly exports dollars. And the issuer of the global reserve currency can't tolerate a gradual decline, because losing money printing ability will mean an Argentina-like tumble to something like the #50 spot rather than a graceful descent to #2.\n\nThat's what underpins the push to retain or even expand empire, a push that is now nearing the end of the line. For obvious reasons, the American public doesn't really want to hear this kind of truth, and it's also not obvious that saying it would help.\n\nAnyway: I'm not constrained in that way, so I can speak the truth as I see it. I may of course be wrong, but citations follow.\n\nCITATIONS\n\n[1]: Clip of Hegseth on the Shawn Ryan pod before he became Secretary: \"If 15 [Chinese] hypersonic missiles can take out our ten aircraft carriers in the first 20 minutes of a conflict, what does that look like?\"\nhttps://t.co/gred8qeq9H\n\n[2]: Video of Raytheon CEO explaining that they can't decouple from China:\nhttps://t.co/ZLuzmQS2od\n\n[3]: Clip of former US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro noting that one Chinese shipyard has more shipbuilding capacity than the entire US Navy combined:\nhttps://t.co/qz2LKzTkKt\n\n[4]: Pentagon-commissioned Govini study showing that the US military is made in China: https://t.co/8XcKYw98cy\n\n[5]: Pentagon is reportedly withdrawing from China to focus on the Western hemisphere:\nhttps://t.co/uOl5QYTWU1\n\n[5b]: See also @DoggyDog1208 on how China may have scaled so fast that it obviated the Thucydides trap: https://t.co/TLTirAYKAK\n\n[6]: Dollar inflation is global taxation:\nhttps://t.co/Je8ddU1xyc\n\nYields up, gold and digital gold at all time highs:\nhttps://t.co/ItY6Vnb3Qj\n\n[7]: Graph from @LukeGromen showing the debasement of the Roman denarius vs the debasement of the American dollar:\n\n[8]: Elon is our best guy, and went all in, and concluded that he did his best. He further noted on the All-In Pod that the US government is simply beyond fixing:\nhttps://t.co/ih1O9gWo0t\n\nIf you combine his notes with Dalio, Turchin, the Sovereign Individual, the Fourth Turning, and frankly dozens of other commentators at this point...what emerges isthat something comparable to the end of the USSR is approaching, a national insolvency.\n\n[9]: I wrote a piece on an Internet-native version of the special economic zone, the Special Elon Zone. Essentially, take some abandoned piece of land, keep most of the laws, but sunset select old regulations so that we can build at the speed of physics not permits:\nhttps://t.co/fKdLlAWxQ4\n\n[10]: Here's a bit more on the shift from Christendom to the West, which will be comparably important to the shift from the West to the Internet. It isn't just the American dollar decentralizing to the Internet via Bitcoin, but American society.\nhttps://t.co/JG6wTzSpom\n\n[11]: The Internet is currently intangible, but it won't always be so. See this post on how popups are the new startups:\nhttps://t.co/Npc8zbPbCm\n\n[12]: The concept of \"Internet First\" is simultaneously a play on words of \"America First\" but also \"mobile first\". It's a technopolitical strategy. It observes that the Internet is the first thing you check in the morning, and the first place you go for your transactions and your communications, and actually also the first place for ostensibly Nation First political movements.\n\nThe logic is that ultimately the Internet will come from the background to the foreground, and that 21st century ideologies will be built explicitly on Internet First grounds.\n\nOr as Larry Page put it, \"If you look at the different kinds of laws we make, they're very old. The laws when we went public we're 50 years old...A law can't [necessarily] be right if it's 50 years old, like it's before the Internet, that's a pretty major change.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/iLWZ1Ztz5b",

    "fullText": "At first that may be what\u2019ll happen.\n\nBut think about how the US was balanced for decades by the USSR. And during that period, the US was a better actor than the USSR. West Germany was better off than East Germany, South Korea was more prosperous than North Korea, and in general the US strengthened its allies while the Soviets didn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, once the USSR fell, the US gradually became unbalanced. After 1991, it invaded too many countries and printed too much money \u2014 both to its own citizens\u2019 detriment and to the world\u2019s.\n\nSimilarly, for decades China has de facto been balanced abroad by America. At home China is a one-party state, but abroad it is a two-party state \u2014 because America also gets a vote. China has to play nice with the world, because the world has a choice.\n\nWhat happens when the world doesn\u2019t have a choice? When the US pulls back its troops to focus on its internal conflicts, much as the USSR did three decades ago? When China has a completely free hand?\n\nSure, it probably won\u2019t throw its weight around in exactly the same way the US did. China is historically a much more inward-looking civilization, and may not want Chinese troops on the ground everywhere.\n\nStill, China is rational. And as a hyperpower they\u2019ll see no need to bargain, so they won\u2019t. The cost of participating in their new tributary system will just continuously rise, unless there is some kind of Yin to balance the Chinese Yang.\n\nAnd the Internet is the only thing on earth with comparable economic scale to China.

We can only give broad sketches in a tweet. But if you're interested in the long-form version, register to attend in person or remotely at https://t.co/oOx0ShxUCC.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve started internet companies, we\u2019ve started internet currencies, and now we\u2019re starting internet communities.

    "id": "1970566773012603082",
    "fullText": "I was a bit confused by the quote tweeted chart. Were there really that many AI companies making $100M in 3.5 years, that it was only a top quartile thing, given that ChatGPT is only three years old?\n\nI spoke to @jmelaskyriazi and he said his quartile graph is not an empirical cohort chart. That is, it\u2019s not taking the revenue trajectories of 1000 AI companies and then showing that the top 250 hit $100M ARR in 3.5 years. It is instead an extrapolation of growth rates based on three buckets (he has a post on his methodology).\n\nWithout meaning any offense, I think this extrapolation could be misleading. Because a true cohort chart that includes the countless AI startups that don\u2019t ever make it to $1M ARR would show that getting to $100M ARR in 3.5 years is still amazing, and not merely a top 25% phenomenon. Probably at least top 5% if not top 1%, depending on what counts as an AI startup.\n\nThat\u2019s because the companies that quickly hit $100M ARR are typically ones whose names you know, like Midjourney and Cursor (see graph below). Moreover, Replit and OpenAI, impressive as they are, wouldn\u2019t qualify because they were founded way more than three years ago.\n\nSo: if you\u2019re a founder, yes, getting to $100M ARR in 3.5 years is still phenomenal. And getting to $72M ARR in 5 years is also phenomenal, particularly if you can maintain strongly positive margins. Even with inflation, these are tough numbers to hit.",

However, even Uber lost money for many years. And the micromobility companies did create enormous consumer value, and Lime is apparently going public.\n\n(3) Third, just about every major tech company was attacked on profitability grounds for years. Consider the headline below, or \u201cGoogle\u2019s toughest search is for a business model\u201d, or the articles proclaiming Amazon dot bomb.\n\n(4) In short, it\u2019s just not easy to determine which fast-growing companies will improve margins. Tesla did it relatively late in life. If you can do it well you could be a great growth stage VC.",

    "fullText": "TIEBOUT SORTING \u2192 NETWORK STATE\nThe mathematical basis for the network state is Tiebout sorting. In 1956, Charles Tiebout proved that if you had:\n\n(a) low-cost mobility\n(b) frictionless discovery\n(c) no inter-jurisdictional spillover effects, and\n(d) many possible jurisdictions\n\n...then individuals could vote with their feet by sorting themselves into communities that efficiently matched their preferences for public goods.\n\nThose assumptions were theoretical in 1956, but practical by 2026. Thanks to the Internet, mobility is low-cost (due to remote work), discovery of new jurisdictions is inexpensive, and \"spillover\" is minimal because only SaaS subscribers get the costs and benefits of digitally provided public services.\n\nAll that remains is to set up many possible jurisdictions...and we're on it. In this fashion, we can build the 1000-community system as the genuinely democratic alternative to the 2-party system. Instead of submitting to gerrymandering, you can instead vote with your feet, your wallet, and your ballot all at once by gaining admission to a new Tiebout jurisdiction and signing the corresponding social smart contract.\n\nThe Internet can thus make true democracy a reality, by going to its original definition in the sense of the consent of the governed. Pick your country at age 18 instead of picking your college. Apply to the jurisdictions you want to join, and if they admit you, give your voluntary, digitally-signed consent to the corresponding government.\n\nTiebout sorting is thus the basis for 100% democracy: everyone in a Tiebout jurisdiction has voted with their feet for that government.",

    "id": "1964251954781311369",
    "fullText": "MAGA has thrown in the towel on China.\nThis is completely understandable.\nBut it has many implications.\n\n(1) First, what just happened? The new National Defense Strategy[1] is reportedly pivoting away from China and towards the homeland. Many troops will be brought back...at first to enforce the border, and perhaps soon to patrol the streets as they're doing in DC.\n\n(2) Second, why did it happen? Because the US military is made in China. You can't fight your factory. And the stark numerical reality is that Chinese production in many sectors is unfortunately far beyond anything America can match for the foreseeable future, particularly without its now alienated allies.\n\nAfter all, there would be no tariffs if US factories could compete with Chinese factories:\n\n(3) Wait, no really, why did it happen? It's also because the Russian military has de facto defeated NATO in Ukraine, the Houthis have kept the Suez closed, and the last twenty years of forever war and political crisis have led many Americans to understandably believe their empire is simply too much of a burden.\n\nAfter all, there would be no attempt at a peace treaty if US-backed forces could simply defeat the Russian military. Even the journos now admit this:\n\n(4) OK, so what happens next? Right now there are ~750 US military bases globally. Many will get shut down over the next several years as a consequence of both US pullback and international retaliation for the trade war. This is similar to the Soviet wind-down after 1991.\n\nThat's what becoming a country, not an empire means: pullback of all this presence to just the homeland.\n\n(5) And then what happens? Well, we'll all miss Uncle Sam when he's gone. Because China is far more MAGA than MAGA. It's a completely self-interested ethnostate that's armed to the teeth and that will bully any country that doesn't do as it sees fit.\n\nToday, it's true that China is making all the right noises about win/win cooperation and the rights of small countries and so on. And it will probably keep that up for a while, as trade routes get recentralized around China thanks to the opportunity provided by MAGA tariffs.\n\nBut no individual state, and probably no coalition, can physically go tank-for-tank and plane-for-plane with the Chinese drone armada. So the leverage that China has over the world (and its own citizens) via sheer physical compulsion will eventually prove tempting.\n\nThat means we'll need an asymmetric strategy to balance China. A digital yin that constrains their physical yang. I do think the Internet can get there. It is after all the only thing with comparable economic scale to China. And it's actually upstream of all the drones, robots, transactions, and communications. But that's a discussion for another time. The first step is to understand what's happening at this time.",

And it would likely inflame China hawks in both parties who view the country\u2019s leadership as a danger to U.S. security.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a major shift for the U.S. and its allies on multiple continents,\u201d said one of the people briefed on the draft document. \u201cThe old, trusted U.S. promises are being questioned.\u201d\n\nThe report usually comes out at the start of each administration, and Hegseth could still make changes to the plan. But in many ways, the shift is already occurring. The Pentagon has activated thousands of National Guard troops to support law enforcement in Los Angeles and Washington, and dispatched multiple warships and F-35 fighter planes to the Caribbean to interdict the flow of drugs to the U.S.\n\nA U.S. military strike this week allegedly killed 11 suspected members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang in international waters, a major step in using the military to kill noncombatants.\n\nThe Pentagon also has established a militarized zone across the southern border with Mexico that allows troops to detain civilians, a job normally reserved for law enforcement.\n\nThe new strategy would largely overturn the focus of the first Trump administration\u2019s 2018 National Defense Strategy, which placed deterring China at the forefront of the Pentagon\u2019s efforts....\n\n[1]: https://t.co/v8C1XWUPkF\n\n[2]: https://t.co/gred8qeq9H",

  "2025-09-01|DECOUPLING FROM DOLLARS The US sends India billion": {
    "id": "1962618982692966850",
    "fullText": "DECOUPLING FROM DOLLARS\nThe US sends India billions in printed dollars for valuable goods. This is actually the US government ripping off India, like it does Vietnam, and everyone else, including its own citizens...not vice versa.\n\nTo be precise: last year India exported $87B of valuable goods to the US for $42B of goods plus $45B worth of increasingly worthless dollars:\n\nThat difference of $45B was, effectively, made up by money printing, which the Fed does at will:\n\nThe current administration incorrectly thinks this is a bad deal for America, because they haven\u2019t fully thought through the fact that the US can print dollars. India was giving America something that's always valuable (namely goods) for something that America can just print out of thin air (namely US dollars):\n\nSo...who was really ripping off whom?\n\nAs mentioned, this is the same trade America had with Vietnam. Vietnam worked hard to send America shoes, while America sent Vietnam printed dollars. And it\u2019s the same trade America had with many countries, before the trade war. The world sends the US valuable goods, and gets mere Federal Reserve database entries in return:\n\nThe only reason the US had the right to do that \u2014 to run the financial database of the world, to print trillions for itself, and to freeze and seize the funds of billions \u2014 is because it set up what we call the rules-based order, what is in reality the American Empire. And of course it profited from that empire tremendously, but so did most of the empire's participants.\n\nBut now MAGA is dismantling that empire. It\u2019s cutting off trade, talent, and even tourism. It\u2019s abandoning its military commitments and telling allies to fend for themselves. It\u2019s cutting off foreign aid and domestic universities. It is, in short, becoming a country not an empire.\n\nThe reason is because MAGA is fundamentally confused. It romanticizes 1945 America (the manufacturing country) without fully admitting that 2025 America makes its money in a completely different way, by managing the hub of a global financial empire.\n\nBecause the US is in denial about what it is \u2014 a money printer, not a manufacturer \u2014 it's currently on track to lose both the money-printing and the manufacturing. For example, the tariffs target the entire world (thereby reducing demand for the dollar in global trade) while also cutting off machine tools and raw materials from US entrepreneurs (thereby inhibiting the buildout of domestic manufacturing).\n\nAnyway, I won't linger on the outlook for the US. It's made its decision and will live with it. Perhaps it will indeed be a Golden Age of Reindustrialization. And perhaps the transition to a \"republic, not an empire\" will go much better than the similar imperial climbdown of the UK or the USSR.\n\nWhat should countries like India and Vietnam do?\n\nThey should turn a necessity into a virtue. The trade war has provided a powerful Schelling Point for the entire world to simultaneously stop using the dollar at the same time. This is also what America says it wants, for foreigners to stop \"exploiting\" it by accepting its printed dollars for hard goods.\n\nSo: abide by America's wishes and stop trading goods with America for dollars. Instead, trade goods with each other for local currencies (rather than USDs) and use gold for storing value (rather than USTs). Because there is no global reserve currency issued by a single country, trade remains roughly balanced over time.\n\nSingapore's former PM calls this \"world minus one.\" It's the continuation of global capitalism, just without America, who has voluntarily taken itself out of the game. Yes, there's a short-term adaptation cost, but the quicker that a country can decouple from the dollar the better.\n\nStart saving in hard money instead.",

    "fullText": "POLITICAL BILLIONAIRES\n\nThe clip below is a good encapsulation of what modern China is by Eric X. Li, who\u2019s one of the most thoughtful Chinese nationalists.\n\nI appreciate his description, because the Internet is the exact opposite. Because on the Internet, capital (in the form of Bitcoin, and more generally smart contracts) really does stand above any given state.\n\nThe negative way of framing this emerging reality is that Internet capitalists are now above national governments. The positive way of framing it is: anyone can become an Internet capitalist, and there is now truly global rule-of-code that no state can easily abrogate. Moreover, individuals can\u2019t have their digital rights revoked even by powerful states.\n\nAs for whether it\u2019s bad if \u201cbillionaires\u201d have influence over the government\u2026the reality is that political leaders control many billions in assets. For example, a city like SF with ~$16B in annual budget and 11 supervisors plus a mayor essentially has 12 political billionaires.\n\nEach of these political billionaires allocates $1B+ per year in cash, on average. This is orders of magnitude more than a typical tech billionaire allocates. That\u2019s because tech billionaires might have $1B in net worth but perhaps only $10-50M liquid.\n\nSo: market billionaires actually have far less in the way of financial resources than political billionaires. A market billionaire might allocate perhaps $100M over the course of their lifetime, whereas a political billionaire will allocate $1B+ in a single year. This is a >100X differential.\n\nNow, yes, it\u2019s true that political billionaires have less for personal consumption than market billionaires do, but that is (almost by definition) societally unimportant. A political billionaire spending a billion on government worker salaries does a lot more to steer the world than a pair of fancy shoes.\n\nOne might also argue that political budgets are less discretionary than market budgets, and I\u2019d agree, but the sheer scale of public budgets makes up for it. Even if only 1% of a $16B city budget is discretionary, that\u2019s $160M in discretionary cash per year.\n\nAnyway, the point is that anyone in control of a giant public budget is already in full billionaire mode. They are allocating billions in capital, so they are political billionaires. You are going to have billionaire-run government in this sense no matter what.",

    "id": "1961901722571575764",
    "fullText": "Let me address this point, as it is important.\n\n(1) The Chinese system is run like a giant corporation. You have to run a 30k person township before you can govern a 500k person county before you manage a 5M person prefecture. Each level up becomes more competitive, and promotion requires a combination of numerical results plus political standing within the party.\n\n(2) So, in China, you\u2019d never go rapidly from a civilian role to high office, like Obama or Trump. You\u2019d have to work your way up. On the other hand, the American system has the theoretical advantage of generating out-of-left-field leaders, which is hard for the Chinese system.\n\n(3) Now, the Internet system combines aspects of both the Chinese and American system. Like the Chinese system, there is a tiered, promotional ladder based in large part on numerical results. We call it seed round, Series A, Series B, and so on! However, unlike the Chinese system, the Internet system can rapidly advance talent from all around the world, without the need to conform and pay party dues for years. Moreover, you can bootstrap and rise almost entirely outside the formal system.\n\n(4) I am skeptical that the non-quantitative American system can generate the political leaders capable of competing with the Chinese system. For decades, innumerate US politicians have just been completely out-executed in the physical world by Chinese political leaders who are just much more technical than they are (as @danwwang \u2018s recent book also points out). And as the American electoral process tilts ever more towards charismatic social media presence, and ever less towards dispassionate execution-oriented mindsets, the trendlines aren\u2019t in the right direction.\n\n(5) However, I think the Internet system has already proven itself capable of generating economic leaders who can compete with (and outcompete, in many cases) their Chinese economic counterparts.\n\n(6) The question is whether the Internet system can also generate political leaders capable of (peacefully) competing with Chinese political leadership, for some definition of competing. For example: can we use the Internet to create not just new companies but new cities, competitive with the best Chinese cities? We\u2019ll see. This is the long-term project of startup societies and network states.",

    "id": "1958218168499057115",
    "fullText": "TRADEOFFS DO EXIST\n\nSeveral things are true at the same time.\n\n(1) First, woke is cancer, and US universities are one of the primary sources of this cancer. They are the furthest left organizations in the world, and still radically out of sync with the people who fund them. This just came out in Nature:\n\n(2) So, the use of state power against wokeness is probably the only way to course correct, because academic wokeness is funded by the state. State power could be like chemotherapy against the cancer.\n\n(3) However, just as it is possible for the Western university to die from cancer, it is also possible for the university to die from chemotherapy. Particularly if no distinction is made between healthy and unhealthy tissue.\n\n(4) And the recent academic budget cuts are hitting the relatively healthy STEM part of academia, as opposed to the completely unhealthy humanities part.\n\n(5) That\u2019s not to say that STEM hasn\u2019t been corrupted by woke too. It has, particularly in medicine. But there was still some residual healthy tissue, some very smart people doing good things.\n\n(6) One of the world\u2019s greatest living mathematicians (Terry Tao) was among that healthy tissue. If you read his blog, he really isn\u2019t a far leftist. True, he posted against Trump once in 2016 (but so did much of the current admin). And yes, Tao did sign a letter during the BLM riots of 2020 (but even Trump at the time felt compelled to \u201chonor the memory of George Floyd\").\n\n(7) Remember, the social pressure to fit in at UCLA during BLM was even greater than society at large. Wokes, like communists, demand public pledges of fealty to stop harassing you. That doesn\u2019t mean those public pledges are always deeply felt or sincere. Indeed, it is the relatively apolitical STEM guys like Tao who often go along to get along.\n\n(8) Anyway, if one can\u2019t or won\u2019t make distinctions between a Terry Tao and a genuinely far left humanities prof, you will lose all the healthy tissue. The chemotherapy will kill the host. And four hundred years of Harvard's rise will come to an end.\n\n(9) That said, to steelman the MAGA side, one can actually make the case that the end of Harvard (and the Western university system writ broadly) actually is net good for the world! After all, US universities exported many bad ideas globally, particularly recently. From the claim that XX/XY chromosomes have no relevance in medicine, to the idea that prestigious citations count for more than independent replication, to the decades of attacks on white people simply for being white.\n\n(10) And, to further steelman the right, it is of course hard and time-consuming to separate the innocent from the guilty among the faculty. Indeed it may not even be possible in the time available, given that MAGA may lose political power in a few years. So perhaps it\u2019s now or never.\n\n(11) Fine. But nature abhors a vacuum. And if you leave a smoking crater where Harvard was, that vacuum will currently get filled by China (with certainty) and perhaps the Internet (if we\u2019re lucky). For example:\n\n(12) Anyway, I\u2019m sympathetic to both the argument that woke is cancer and needed treatment and the reality that many talented individuals are becoming collateral damage here.\n\n(13) We\u2019ve seen something similar before. In the early 1900s, Europe was the unquestioned leader in science. But then, after all the fighting between right and left, science left for the stable terrain of America. The graph below quantifies this for the physics Nobel:\n\n(14) History may repeat. In the early 2000s, America was similarly the unquestioned global leader in science. But after all the fighting between right and left, science is digitally decentralizing to the Internet (with professors becoming tech founders) and physically recentralizing in Asia (with China taking over traditional academia):\n\n(15) In other words, tradeoffs do exist. It might still be worth it for MAGA to wreck US academia, to break the source of woke in the few years they have power, regardless of what collateral damage occurs. It'd be an immensely altruistic move, like throwing the one ring into the fires of Mount Doom. MAGA would essentially be saving the world from Western leftism by shutting down all sources of blue power, like the universities and the US dollar, and thereby ending the empire.\n\n(16) It'd be like Gorbachev and the Russians shutting down the USSR, thereby ending the careers of many brilliant Soviet scientists (and Russia's own predominance on the world stage) in the process of shutting down a far left empire.\n\nGorbachev saved the world from communism at the expense of Russian power. MAGA may similarly save the world from wokism at the expense of American power. That may not be what they intend to do, but it is arguably what they're actually doing.",

Just like wokeness, the far left tried replacing faith in G-o-d with faith in G-o-v.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that communism is centralized left and wokeness is decentralized left, but for the purposes of this discussion those are details. Both doctrines elevated the State over God as the central force that should always do something.\n\nFor example, think about how a woke mocks \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d after a tragedy in favor of the ostensible practicality of \u201cpassing a law.\u201d Or how wokes used the state to target traditional religious beliefs directly, such as their suits against the Christian bakery. Or, finally, how a woke talks about being a hecking good person as an ersatz replacement for traditional moral codes.\n\nAll of that was replacement of God in favor of a different doctrine that centered the State. \n\nSo, it isn\u2019t surprising that after the State failed, after communism failed, that Russian belief in Orthodox Christianity would rise:\n\nNor is it surprising that after wokeness failed, that American belief in both Catholicism and traditional Christianity would rise:\n\nThat return to religion is one of two major responses to a failed state. It\u2019s the conservative response, where God becomes the organizing principle rather than the State. (The other is the technologist response, where the Network takes over from the State.)\n\nBut anyway. That\u2019s the structural reason for the return to religious faith.

    "fullText": "All this may change as tech evolves. Perhaps everyone gets their own highly personalized writer, such that the AI copy they emit isn't cliche-ridden and overwritten.\n\nBut at least for now...there's an instant turnoff when you see someone use AI text verbatim in an application form, or a Substack post, or a tweet. It just signals that they can't write well, or that they're lazy, or something.\n\nTo be clear, AI is useful for coding, for data analysis, for snippets of legal work, for situations where there's a right answer. It's useful for searching the web, for suggesting synonyms, for cleaning up audio transcripts, for summarizing huge docs, and in general as an assistant.\n\nBut it's not useful as a replacement for your writing. As soon as you read a few sentences of AI text, it just clangs on the ear.\n\nI have to say that I kind of get why some artists hate AI. I think AI images/video are extremely useful for someone who can't draw to get something out of their mind's eye onto the page, but I get why artists who identify themselves with their art dislike it. AI art makes it harder for them to stand out.\n\nSimilarly, AI-generated text is probably very useful for someone who speaks English as a second language (or just isn't that good as a writer). It helps them put together an essay from their bullet points. I get all that,  and there are situations where it's very reasonable to use (eg realtime translation).\n\nBut unless the AI text is better than your best writing, you really shouldn't use it verbatim in high-stakes contexts.",

    "fullText": "From @ryanmcmaken in 2022:\n\n\"It took some time for the official numbers to catch up with reality. The regime\u2019s official numbers had long understated even the moderate levels of price inflation in earlier periods, but after the mid-80s, the gap between official inflation and estimated real inflation grew considerably.\n\nEfremov\u00a0summarizes\u00a0the divergence, noting that in 1988 official inflation was 0.6 percent but 6 percent in the\u00a0real\u00a0marketplace. By 1989, official inflation was 2 percent, but it was really 8 percent. In 1990, it was 5.3 percent, but really 20 percent. And then the wheels started to really come off in 1991, with 96.3 \u201cofficial\u201d inflation that was really 200 percent.\n\nThe Soviet Union collapsed shortly thereafter, and the new regime did not issue falsified inflation numbers anymore. Instead, the real inflation rate in 1992 was estimated to be more than 2,300 percent. Hyperinflation continued for three more years until the old Soviet ruble finally ceased to exist.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/XSTjnZ4pA7",

  "2025-08-08|THE TELEGRAM NETWORK STATE?  The Telegram TON IPO": {
    "id": "1953902120102769039",
    "fullText": "THE TELEGRAM NETWORK STATE?\n\nThe Telegram TON IPO could be important.\nMainly because they get the importance.\n\nBut first...ok, yes, what got announced it isn\u2019t technically a Telegram offering, nor is TON formally issued by Telegram, nor is it really even an IPO. To be precise, what just launched is a crypto treasury company called VERB that holds $500M+ of TON, which is a coin issued by a foundation that was once formally affiliated with Telegram and then became independent but is now affiliated again.\n\nGot all that? But these are really just implementation details. The offering could be important[1] simply because (a) Telegram has a billion users, and (b) TON is now the official coin of those billion users, and (c) Telegram can now officially partner with TON because (d) crypto is now fully legal.\n\nSo, the potential is clear. Though it was a long and arduous struggle between network and state to get here. Let's review.\n\n(1) First, Telegram fought the law and the law\u2026did not win. Briefly, Telegram created TON back in 2018, but an SEC injunction made them turn TON into an independent foundation. However, after the recent democratically-mandated defenestration of Gary Gensler, we saw the regulatory state capitulate and TON reintegrate with Telegram.\n\n(2) Next, the French state fought Pavel Durov and that state\u2026did not yet win. Briefly, some French prosecutor came up with a fake case against Durov and grabbed him off a plane. This destroyed @emmanuelmacron\u2019s ambitions to make France \u201cstartup friendly\u201d, because investors just avoid France now after Durov's illegitimate prosecution.\n\n(3) The UAE has intervened on Durov\u2019s behalf, and he\u2019s now reportedly been let out of house arrest to return to Dubai. If justice still exists, then Durov should beat his case, just as Trump beat his own political prosecutions. In part that's because the case is predicated on the ridiculous idea that Durov is personally responsible for every message sent by the 1B+ users on his platform. That\u2019s like holding Macron personally responsible for every crime committed by 67M Frenchmen. It\u2019s just an unrealistic demand for a zero-crime digital environment, by a French state that can\u2019t itself control crime at all.\n\n(4) Anyway, the real reason the French state is going after Durov is the same reason the Blue American state went after Elon and the Chinese state went after Jack Ma. It's because men like Durov are genuine leaders, and their growing strength scares bureaucratic incumbents.\n\nBecause if there was a technodemocratic[2] plebiscite held, the billion users of Telegram could produce more votes (and hence more democratic legitimacy) for the popular Durov than the 67M French would for the unpopular Macron. The enormous popularity of the heads-of-network means they could become not just more competent but more legitimate than heads-of-state. This is one part of what the bureaucrats (instinctively, inarticulately) fear.\n\n(5) The other part is that that a fusion of a messaging app and a cryptocurrency allows something even bigger than a social network to emerge. With communication + AI moderation + crypto transactions, you have something more like a digital economy, one that bureaucrats can't control. Which is the other thing bureaucrats fear.\n\n(6) Of course, all that is predicated on actually getting a Telegram coin launched, and making it tradeable, and allowing it to formally integrate with the app. And all that was fought by various states for the better part of a decade, and now all that resistance is finally melting away, seven years after the whole TON thing began.\n\nAnyway, so that's why this is interesting to me. Founders like Durov built networks the size of countries, and finally have currencies to match. And as you can see from the video below (from the President of TON Foundation) and the tweet below (from the founder of Telegram), both Telegram and TON are well aware of the potential. They see the beginnings of a cloud country...a network state, if you will.\n\nThey see the importance.",

    "id": "1951949738577985748",
    "fullText": "I have good news.\n\nYes, the land is moving in an illiberal direction. It\u2019s disorderly anarcho-nationalism and anarcho-communism in America. And disturbingly ordered nationalist communism in China.\n\nBusinessmen are now randomly murdered in the USA and randomly expropriated in the PRC. All manner of hatred bursts forth every day on social media \u2014 against whites, nonwhites, men, women, the young, the old, and everyone in between. And the values of peace, trade, and win/win cooperation that built the modern world seem like they\u2019re on the ropes. \n\nBut all is not lost.\n\nBecause the cloud is moving in the opposite direction. As the Internet is actually existing liberalism. After all, it is international capitalism. And preserves American values in the cloud even as both socialists and nationalist traduce them on American soil. Indeed, the Internet is to America as America was to Britain \u2014 the version 3.0 of global liberalism.\n\nAnd the geographic center of liberalism is moving to the decentralized Internet just as it moved from London to DC. Just as we\u2019ve already seen the torch passed from the British pound to the American dollar to the decentralized Bitcoin. But in this process the values of liberalism stay intact, and even strengthen, even as the mere geography (and demography!) changes.\n\nBecause the free Internet is an ideological zone, not a country. A proposition, not a nation, that anyone can subscribe to.\n\nNow, the response from some at this point is usually that the Internet isn\u2019t a place. That\u2019s true\u2026but Christianity isn\u2019t a place either. Yet there are Christian places. There are churches, cathedrals, and entire countries with the cross on the flag. And also a billion Christians around the world, for whom Christian values are a major part of their identity.\n\nSimilarly, the Internet isn\u2019t a place, but there are Internet places. There are startups, datacenters, tech conferences, and even countries where Bitcoin is the national currency. And there are now many millions of Bitcoiners around the world, for whom Bitcoin\u2019s values are a major part of their identity. Bitcoiners are the first truly Internet-born nation, and arguably the most important, but they won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThose Internet nations can organize online, pool their funding, and peacefully buy pieces of territory all over the world. Thereby forming startup societies and, in the fullness of time, network states. Where liberal values are in fact valued.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t count out liberalism. It has ascended to the cloud in a newer and stronger form. One where our rights are protected across borders (and within them) by hard code rather than soft laws.\n\nFor example: a failed state can vitiate the protections against unreasonable search and seizure, but it can\u2019t break strong encryption. It can unbank you and denaturalize you, but it can\u2019t strip your Bitcoin address or ENS name. And it can break Delaware\u2019s contracts, but not smart contracts.\n\nThat means we have code that is in a deep sense stronger than unreasonable people and unjust laws. And so we can use it to reboot liberalism, from the cloud. Just like we reclaimed free speech, we can reclaim capitalism, science, media, equality, democracy, and progress itself.",

    "id": "1951896924778532864",
    "fullText": "Strongly disagree.\n\n(1) The actual reform would be to make IPOs easier, by essentially eliminating Sarbox. And we'll actually get that reform... but only via crypto, because all companies will become cryptoequities. However, that means they'll list on Internet capital markets and crypto exchanges, rather than NYSE/NASDAQ.\n\n(2) See how the number of US public companies has crashed since the early 2000s? Then, ten years later, the number of Internet coins started soaring. The big picture is that we're just sunsetting US capital markets in favor of Internet capital markets.\n\n(3) Now, let's talk about why random government interference with voluntary capitalist transactions is so bad.\n\n(a) First, bigcos (invisibly) reduce already rare M&A activity, because they need to budget for a global fight with regulators just to get a deal done.\n\n(b) Next, bigcos are forced into baroque deal structures, like the recent Character, Scale, Inflection, Adept, Covariant, and Windsurf deals, which can cause drama for everyone.\n\n(c) And, bigcos are forced to fight to the death with startups rather than surrender to them by acquiring them. In practice this often means political skullduggery.\n\n(d) Finally, bigcos put far less of their profits into exits, which in turns results in less money for tech startups. After all, a big M&A is a big surrender for a bigco, as they'd prefer not to capitulate to a startup by buying them.\n\nSo: that means less M&A, more complexity, more politics, and less money. That's like every dysfunctional socialist country, where businesses need to use political connections simply to get a deal done.\n\nTo be clear: of course I understand the hostility towards Big Tech, which did after all censor millions. But regulations in general strengthen bigcos by making it so complex and expensive to do things that startups can't compete (or, in this case, get acquired).\n\nFinally: the Elizabeth Warren/Lina Khan faction of statists generally haven't founded businesses and certainly don't want to advance technology. Their actual policy goal was to kill tech and stop us from getting to Mars.\n\nSometimes they're explicit about it; see poster below.  The only edit you'd make is that they were building an anti-tech army, and that army was (for now) defeated on the battlefield of ideas.",

    "id": "1951720105341317223",
    "fullText": "Success truly has a thousand fathers, and failure is an orphan. Because the Figma IPO is so big that apparently even the most dedicated anti-tech haters want to get their name into the winner\u2019s circle.\n\nBut the chutzpah here is off the charts. This one reminds me of Gensler taking credit for the Bitcoin ETF, after he got forcibly dragged across the finish line by a court process.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\n(1) First, the amazing thing about tech \u201cmonopolies\u201d is that we have so many of them. That is, we have at least seven giant US companies capable of making huge acquisitions, and easily a few dozen worldwide. So the market failure ostensibly motivating interference with M&A just isn\u2019t there in the first place.\n\n(2) Second, if you cut off the flow of M&A, it results in fewer exits because most companies can\u2019t make it all the way to IPO. The reason they can\u2019t is because of Sarbox, another gift from the regulatory state that makes it hard to IPO.\n\n(3) If there are fewer exits, and exits are much more uncertain (due to the fear of random antitrust harassment!) you get weird deal structures or no deals at all. That means fewer dollars to invest in tech.\n\n(4) And that was the goal of the entire anti-techlash movement over the last decade, of which the \u201cantitrust\u201d stuff was a key part. Their entire goal was to kill funding for tech startups, and wokify the ones that survived. Because tech companies had disrupted Blue America\u2019s power centers and taken away media ad revenue.\n\n(5) Finally, the sheer fact that Figma survived and made it was because of the founder and his team\u2019s effort. To be whiplashed out of a giant acquisition is an enormous strain. To resume the climb after such a disappointment is more than all but the very best teams could handle. \n\nAnyway \u2014 Figma is one of the very best teams and managed to rally and pull out a win, despite the best efforts of anti-capitalists on multiple continents to kill their company.\n\nUltimately, the anti-capitalists just don\u2019t understand the concept of economic consent. Yes means yes.",

The issue is that those armaments need to be price-competitive abroad to win any war of attrition abroad.\n\nFor example, if their drones cost $2000 and your missiles cost $2M, that can only be sustained so long as the money printer keeps cranking out cash. Adopting global tariffs makes it much less likely that the money printer endures.\n\nMoreover, tariffs and subsidies actually inhibit the development of a price-competitive military. They are aimed at protecting the home market, not winning the export market.\n\nThe path Russia took after they shut down their global empire and became just a country again was to gradually become an exporter of price-competitive arms, minerals, and natural resources.\n\nIt arguably did work for them, but it took 30+ years.",

  "2025-07-27|All property becomes cryptography. Let me explain": {
    "id": "1949403245811822628",
    "fullText": "All property becomes cryptography.\nLet me explain why.\n\n(1) First, right now, trillions of dollars worth of digital gold is secured onchain. Bitcoin is now valued everywhere there is an internet connection. And no matter what political faction you're in, everyone agrees on the raw fact of who owns what amount of BTC. \n\n(2) Next, right now, the full legalization of stablecoins means that every other asset goes onchain. Because if there is a legal status for onchain currency, of course there's a legal path for onchain stocks, onchain bonds, and every other type of financial asset.\n\n(3) So, that's a lot right there. But there's actually a next step. As you can see from the video below, this door can also be secured with an onchain smart lock. That means the door to your house can be secured by crypto. So can the door to your car.\n\n(4) Indeed, any door can be secured in this way. The door to a plane, to a train, to a boat, to a building. Any door can be secured onchain.\n\n(5) But this is really more than the keys to your car door. It's really the keys to your car itself. The digital signature starts the engine. And that means any piece of capital equipment, from cranes to drones can be similarly secured.\n\n(6) That includes the humanoid robots, the sidewalk robots, the self-driving cars, and just about anything that's controlled electronically. Which is almost everything.\n\n(7) There are exceptions. The food on your plate, the shirt on your back, those can't and won't be secured onchain. But that's actually a negligible fraction of value in the world.\n\n(8) For everything else, for 99%+ of what's valuable, for every financial asset and every capital asset, we will secure it onchain.\n\n(9) And the reason we'll have to do that is that the blockchain is the only truly secure backend. The Pentagon gets repeatedly hacked, as do many web2 services, but scaled public blockchains do not.\n\n(10) So: even the control plane for the drones goes onchain. The blockchain is the basis by which we can build a code-based order on the Internet, a new kind of global economic union that allows anyone with an internet connection to access world-class monetary policy and contractual equality.\n\nAll property becomes cryptography.",

It's now becoming a launchpad for the world. And with 800M+ internet users, most of whom got online in the past decade, along with thousands of years of cultural history, India has both the sheer quantity of users and quality of producers to become a digital power on a global scale.\n\nHuge credit for that improvement must go towards India's domestic political leadership over the last ten years. It wasn't easy to improve the infrastructure to that degree.\n\nBut even if an Indian founder launches in India first as a logistical matter, their mental model should ultimately be Internet First. Because the Internet is the global market. And with the rise of blockchains, it now provides uniform monetary policy, smart contract enforcement, identity, property rights, and dispute resolution to anyone online.\n\nFrom an Indian perspective, you can think of the Internet as the third wave of independence. First, legal independence from London in 1947. Then, physical independence from DC in 1998 with the Pokhran nuclear test. Finally, economic independence through the rise of Reliance Jio and the Internet.\n\nAfter all, an Indian engineer may be a second class citizen in the West, unfortunately now hated by the left for being a capitalist and much of the right for being an immigrant. However, they are first class citizens on the global Internet, where they are finally full equals. That's what a peer-to-peer network means.\n\nHence, Internet First.",

    "fullText": "AI = AN INTERN\nPrompting an AI agent and then reviewing the code can be slower than just coding it yourself.\n\nBut when? Do we have simple heuristics for when to use an agent vs code it yourself?\n\nUse an agent when it's frontend code (which you can instantly inspect for correctness), or interaction with some API (where you know what to do but not the specific incantations for executing the API calls), or a data analysis, or a prototype.\n\nDo it yourself when it's a domain you know very well, or it's highly contextual backend code, or you want to iterate a lot on the result. In these circumstances, writing the prompt takes more time than writing and reviewing the code.\n\nRoughly speaking, if you visualize your app as concentric circles, AI agents are good at the \"shallow\" layers on the outside (like the frontend,  or graphs/charts read from your database) but dangerous in the \"core\" areas where high context is needed and low error rates are critical.\n\nIn bullet point form, AI is better for:\n \n- frontend over backend\n- reads over writes\n- shallow over core\n- prototypes over production\n- starting vs maintaining\n- error-tolerant domains over error-intolerant\n- visual output over financial\n- low-context over high-context\n\nSo, AI is an intern. These criteria could themselves be used by AI agents to signal greater uncertainty when tackling high-context problems. Like an intern saying that they'll try hard, but they might not have enough context.",

It corresponds very closely to the unvested equity number.\n\nBut due to the legal overhead that attends any Big Tech acquisition nowadays, the founder was muzzled and couldn't say this outright. He could only say \"dividending out the balance is an option.\"\n\nSo: the remaining Windsurf shareholders can take that option, dividend out the $100M to employees, and then choose to shut down the company. The outcome is then similar to an acquisition.\n\nIt's just a new, dumb dance that we need to bake into licensing-style deals. Similar to all the other dumb dances regulators make companies do.",

And preferred may be taking a disproportionate tax hit, because it doesn\u2019t qualify for QSBS, just like Scale didn\u2019t qualify.\u201d\n\nCaveats: I haven't seen the waterfall myself, and these deals are complicated, and I don't like to get involved in someone else's business. But in the abstract, ideally all Windsurf employees should get paid as if it was a traditional liquidation waterfall. That may still mean some equity is underwater due to liquidation preferences, or some employees don't get paid if their equity hasn't vested.\n\nThe underlying issue is that the Lina Khan-era FTC has made clean acquisitions harder, so companies need to do licensing deals like this.",

    "fullText": "At the end of the Soviet Union, all the secrets came out.\n\nThe gulag was real, and the cancelled Solzhenitsyn was vindicated. The USSR really had murdered Poles at Katyn, while blaming it on the Nazis. Millions of innocents truly had been liquidated by Lenin and Stalin. And Chernobyl was indeed a coverup.\n\nEverything everyone had darkly suspected to be true was confirmed, and then some. The consequence was the meltdown of a nuclear-armed superpower. It lost its European satellites, and its overseas military bases, and its global influence. The Soviet Union collapsed economically and imploded geographically, shattering into more than a dozen new countries.\n\nThat outcome wasn\u2019t peace and prosperity for all. It was for some, to be clear \u2014 the Eastern Europeans and Baltics are inarguably better off today as independent states. But the fall of the Soviet Union also stoked the kindling for many bloody conflicts, ranging from wars you haven\u2019t heard about (like the Tajikistani civil war) to wars you probably have (like Serbia and Yugoslavia) to wars everyone has heard about (like the invasion of Ukraine.)\n\nToday, 30+ years later, countless Russians and Ukrainians are fighting over a border that was within living memory just an internal boundary of the Soviet Empire. The equivalent would be Blue and Red Americans blowing each other up over the California/Nevada border, or something like that. Yet at the same time, does anyone really want the Soviet Union to still be around, gulags and all?\n\nAnyway. Not making a point either way. Just saying that total societal destabilization through long repressed revelation has happened before, and recently. The consequences were profound.",

    "id": "1943680599639703779",
    "fullText": "The Origins of Political Order by @FukuyamaFrancis talks about the difference between the Chinese and Indian traditions. To oversimplify, China was state above law and India was law above state. \n\n(1) The Chinese took the pragmatic attitude that the emperor was all powerful, so no written law would limit him. But the mountains were high, and the emperor was far away, so he faced practical constraints rather than legal constraints.\n\n(2) The Indians took the opposite stance. The princes of the subcontinent believed they wouldn\u2019t get reincarnated if they violated dharmic law. The Western equivalent would be the god-fearing man.\n\n(3) So in India, the law was above the state. And in China, the state was above the law. These traditions had their faults, but they were comparably successful in one key regard: they built and maintained the earth\u2019s two largest populations over thousands of years.\n\n(4) And we see these two traditions echoed today as we contrast China and the Internet.\n\nIn today\u2019s China, there are seemingly no legal limits on what the state can do. Your chair can turn into a party officer, like Agent Smith from the Matrix, if the state wills it. And thanks to AI, there are no longer many practical limits either. For a Chinese citizen, the mountains are never too high and the emperor is never far away.\n\nThis total centralized control makes China formidable in the physical world. They are perhaps the most physically formidable power to ever exist, with one billion people coordinated via a nation-state-network metaorganism that just cranks out the cars, ships, phones, and drones by the million.\n\n(5) But digital power matters too. And that lies with the global Internet, which is the one thing that has economic scale comparable to China.\n\nIf modern China is state above law, then the Internet is a law above states. Its code-based order constrains any prince. For example, Bukele respects Bitcoin, and abides by its laws. Smart contracts irrevocably bind both signatories. Digital identity becomes primary. And cryptography becomes the law above you and me.\n\n(6) So in a deep sense, China vs the Internet is CCP vs BTC. It is the all-powerful state vs the unbreakable law. It is a different version of last century\u2019s conflict between communism and capitalism, though one observes it is once again a conflict between Eurasian communists and Anglospheric capitalists.\n\nWill the state be stronger than the law, or the law stronger than the state?",

    "fullText": "I\u2019m actually pretty sympathetic to the white American conservative. They were subject to countless slings and arrows over the last several decades, from constant insults to racial quotas, with an extraordinary escalation once wokeness really got underway in 2013.\n\nOver the course of decades they tried all manner of parley with the left, sending many good guys like Mitt Romney, only to find their outstretched hands repeatedly thrown back in their face. So, eventually they just elected Trump. And then even Trump was constantly impeached and undermined during his first term.\n\nAfter that, and the political prosecutions, and the assassination attempts, and the Biden inflation, and the open borders\u2026any residual feeling of charity is gone. Trump voters feel forced to become meaner than they ever wanted to be.\n\nThis extends down from the political realm to the personal, where young American men now quickly learn that nice guys finish last in their post-apocalyptic social landscape.\n\nWith inflation hitting them economically, Tinderification hitting them socially, open borders hitting them demographically, and China hitting them economically, the MAGA man is understandably radicalized politically.\n\nSo: even if I disagree with specific policy moves, even if I think much of what\u2019s happening is actually accelerating the decline rather than reversing it, I do understand why they\u2019re doing it.\n\nThe American right believes that the hour is late, and that a Hail Mary effort in the form of mass deportation and reindustrialization can restore the country of 1945, or maybe 1991, or something like that.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe this Hail Mary can succeed. But neither do I wish to stand in the way. This is their big thing, and they are going to give it the college try, and then we will see what happens on the other side.",

    "id": "1942668191186247784",
    "fullText": "No. But I'm happy to explain.\n\n(1) First, you assume incorrectly that America is a valuable economy that everyone wants to get into, when it's unfortunately more like a bankrupt country that the smart money is rapidly getting out of. That's why BTC has appreciated by >100,000,000X against USD, why gold is at record highs, why yields are soaring, and why the DXY is crashing. I take no pleasure in pointing this out, but I do have to point it out.\n\n(2) Second, you assume incorrectly that airgapping is censorship when it's actually more like digital borders. If X wants to retain both its American and Indian users, it might try to recommend American posts to Americans and Indian posts to Indians, rather than fomenting conflict where there was none before.\n\n(3) Third, you assume incorrectly that airgapping is bad for getting your voice out there as an American. But recall that there are only 77M MAGA but 1.4B from India. In the absence of airgapping, you will eventually be overwhelmed on every thread by English-speaking Indians, who will soon represent the majority of English speakers online (if they aren't already). That will be extremely painful, for you.\n\n(4) Fourth, you assume incorrectly that I'm advocating for continued immigration of tech to the US, when I actually tell global technologists to stop coming to the West and instead decentralize abroad because the system is about to go supernova.\n\n(5) Fifth, you assume incorrectly that every Indian is dependent on the H-1B. But the H-1B is about as central to Indian talent today as the American market is to Chinese trade. That is: it's not so important that it can't be done without.\n\nAs context, after the start of the trade war in 2017, China rerouted most of its trade over the last 10 years to other markets, such that it only gets ~15% of revenue from the US. Like it or not, that means China is essentially indifferent to the 2025 tariffs.\n\nIndians are similarly already rerouting talent flows to places like Dubai in the UAE, which has a higher GDP-per-capita and millionaire density than the US...and is rolling out golden visas even as the US is cutting back on H-1Bs. South Asians are >50% of the UAE, so Dubai is friendly to Indians in a way the US increasingly isn't.\n\nThat is happening simultaneously with the growth of the Indian home market. You might not know this, but India was the fastest growing economy in the world over the last 10 years, even ahead of China:\n\nFinally, and most importantly, because Indians now have the TCP/IP visa, they don't really need the H-1B visa. An Indian engineer may be a second class citizen in America, but they are a first class citizen on the global Internet, and that's all they need.\n\nAnyway: in the long run, I do think Americans and Indians will get along again. But for the foreseeable future I advise Indians to (a) not come to America, (b) not inadvertently boost anti-Indian threads, (c) build themselves up economically in India, in the UAE, and on the Internet, and (d) generally reduce their dependence on the US in every possible respect, especially with respect to the US financial system.\n\nThat's what airgapping means.",

    "id": "1941504015642337565",
    "fullText": "LAWYERS AS VERIFIERS\n\nUse lawyers as AI verifiers. Here\u2019s how.\n\n(1) First, tell the AI that it\u2019s the named partner of the most capable law firm in your city, with expertise not just in corporate law, but tech startups, compliance, accounting, and the like.\n\n(2) Then, draft a memo to the AI describing your business goals in full.\n\n(3) Conclude by asking a list of specific questions. Make sure to add the catch-all question of \u201cis there anything I may have overlooked.\u201d Ask to include citations to specific sections of legal code, caselaw, or sample documents like SAFEs.\n\n(4) Next, run that prompt against several AIs (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity) and assemble answers in a spreadsheet. Questions are rows, answers from each AI are in columns.\n\n(5) Now you have a survey of the space. Note in particular any new concepts or terms you\u2019re unfamiliar with. You might rewrite the memo and resubmit it based on these initial answers.\n\n(6) Once you\u2019re done, you have a draft game plan with citations. Next, ask each AI what legal docs you need, and put together first drafts of them individually with AI. These will have errors, but you will get the gist of what the final product looks like.\n\n(7) At this point you have the basic lay of the land. You can now go to each lawyer with the same memo you shared with the AI, ask them the same questions you asked the AIs, and compare their answers to the results of the AIs.\n\n(8) If the lawyer verifies that the AI produced the right answers, great. Then have the lawyer draft the final docs, possibly working from your AI-aided first drafts. Conversely, if a lawyer says the AI is wrong, that\u2019s highly informative and they\u2019ve added value.\n\n(9) This same strategy works with any service provider, from accountant to doctor. You use AI to structure your search, organize your thinking, and get initial answers to your questions.\n\nThen you run it by human specialists (lawyers, accountants, doctors) to verify whether the AI was right and complete the final step.\n\n(10) To be clear, this approach still requires skill on your end (in terms of prompting) and skill on their end (in terms of via verifying). Because AI doesn\u2019t do it end-to-end, it does it middle-to-middle. \n\nBut this approach does mean you no longer need to spend billable hours to learn the basics. And that means a scrappy startup can save money on lawyers.",

    "fullText": "Everyone is a libertarian on the Internet.\n\nBecause it is simultaneously far more progressive and far more capitalist than any previous society.\n\nIt is ultra-progressive because billions of people from every race, religion, and ethnicity are on the global Internet. Anyone can speak to anyone, broadcast anything, associate with anyone, and do just about whatever they want if it is permitted by code.\n\nIt is also uber-capitalist because billions of people can transact with anyone, hire anyone, work for anyone, found their own businesses, become zillionaires, set up their own servers, and enjoy perfect freedom of association.\n\nThe common thread is individual consent. You consent to sign up to a server. You consent to install an app. And every million-person community on the Internet is formed by a million similar voluntary actions.\n\nSo: the Internet proves that consent scales, that voluntarism scales, that internationalism scales, that capitalism scales.\n\nIt proves this empirically. Because by and large, despite all its faults, the total freedom of the Internet is attractive. The ultra-nationalist nevertheless chooses to post on an international network. The anti-capitalist nevertheless chooses to post through a capitalist phone.\n\nThe reason the Internet works is that code is law. So all the impractical libertarian ideas that presupposed flawless judges or strict property rights suddenly became feasible.\n\nFor example, open borders in the physical world doesn\u2019t work. But in the digital world, a site like Facebook actually can onboard billions of strangers and automatically adjudicate the interactions between them.\n\nSimilarly, polycentric law before the Internet didn\u2019t work, because you couldn\u2019t realistically have multiple legal systems in the same physical location. But now with Bitcoin and Ethereum and Solana, you can simply swap between different monetary policies and contract enforcement as you see fit.\n\nThe fundamental point is that the Internet makes libertarianism more practical.\n\nFor example, the esteemed @RonPaul wrote about ending the Fed, but that couldn\u2019t realistically be done at the level of the state. However, tech libertarians could build Bitcoin, and thereby practically end the Fed at the level of the network.\n\nSimilarly, tech libertarians couldn\u2019t shut down the Post Office, but they could boot up email. They couldn\u2019t reform taxi medallions, but they could boot up Uber. They couldn\u2019t reform these failed states, so they built the alternative on the global network.\n\nSuch examples can be multiplied. But the point is that actually existing libertarianism does exist. It is called the Internet. It is simply the most popular thing in the world, perhaps the most popular thing in human history. It is much more popular than any individual politician or state.\n\nAnd yet it is still underestimated.",

    "fullText": "From the 2024 Financial Report of the United States[1] comes the understatement of the century:\n\n> The total resources needed for all the programs sums to $175.3 trillion in PV terms. This need can be satisfied only through increased borrowing, higher taxes, reduced program spending, or some combination.\n\nTranslation: the average American's assets are the government's collateral[2,3]. Because US citizens have freedom of speech, and the right to bear arms, but no amendment that establishes a max tax. As such, their assets will be seized to pay for their profligate state.\n\nMuch of that may be via inflation, but you should expect direct seizure as well, like Executive Order 6102. It's just past time to be extremely realistic about what's coming. The point of no return was passed long ago.\n\nBecause countries do go bankrupt, just like companies do. And it's bad. There was a lot more shooting in the fall of the USSR than in a typical corporate bankruptcy. But it'll be worse if you're endlessly romantic about it, and aren't prepared for what's to come.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/Fde2aCj7IT\n[2]: https://t.co/F8sA598YZd\n[3]: https://t.co/9i67EYQqgv",

    "id": "1938840903692755135",
    "fullText": "Yes. A few miscellaneous thoughts.\n\n(1) First, the new bottleneck on AI is prompting and verifying. Since AI does tasks middle-to-middle, not end-to-end. So business spend migrates towards the edges of prompting and verifying, even as AI speeds up the middle.\n\n(2) Second, AI really means amplified intelligence, not agentic intelligence. The smarter you are, the smarter the AI is. Better writers are better prompters.\n\n(3) Third, AI doesn\u2019t really take your job, it allows you to do any job. Because it allows you to be a passable UX designer, a decent SFX animator, and so on. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can do that job *well*, as a specialist is often needed for polish.\n\n(4) Fourth, AI doesn\u2019t take your job, it takes the job of the previous AI. For example: Midjourney took Stable Diffusion\u2019s job. GPT-4 took GPT-3\u2019s job. Once you have a slot in your workflow for AI image gen, AI code gen, or the like, you just allocate that spend to the latest model.\n\n(5) Fifth, killer AI is already here \u2014 and it\u2019s called drones. And every country is pursuing it. So it\u2019s not the image generators and chatbots one needs to worry about.\n\n(6) Sixth, decentralized AI is already here and it\u2019s essentially polytheistic AI (many strong models) rather than monotheistic AI (a single all-powerful model). That means balance of power between human/AI fusions rather than a single dominant AI that will turn us all into paperclips/pillars of salt.\n\n(7) Seventh, AI is probabilistic while crypto is deterministic. So crypto can constrain AI. For example, AI can break captchas, but it can\u2019t fake onchain balances. And it can solve some equations, but not cryptographic equations. Thus, crypto is roughly what AI can\u2019t do.\n\n(8) Eighth, I think AI on the whole right now is having a decentralizing effect, because there is so much more a small team can do with the right tooling, and because so many high quality open source models are coming.\n\nAll this could change if self-prompting, self-verifying, and self-replicating AI in the physical world really gets going. But there are open research questions between here and there.",

    "id": "1937843448528457793",
    "fullText": "RECLAIMING DEMOCRACY\n\nI disagree with the idea that democracy must limit economic growth. Moreover, I think we actually need to reclaim democracy just as we reclaimed free speech, because above all democracy means the consent of the governed. But let me first defend democracy's economic track record.\n\n(1) First: democratic India posted the highest economic growth rate in the world over the last ten years, proving that democracy need not hold back an economy:\n\n(2) Second: India is now arguably better at democracy than many Western jurisdictions, as half a billion votes were counted in one day. That shows democracy is feasible even at billion-person scale in the modern age:\n\n(3) Third, perhaps obviously, democratic America was the richest and most successful country in the world. It was able to build for 200+ years, in part because it combined democracy with capitalism and the frontier spirit.\n\n(4) Fourth, as another example of how democracy can actually catalyze economic growth, the democratic vote in the late USSR publicly repudiated the Soviet far left, and led to the economic growth of Eastern Europe and the Baltics.\n\n(5) Fifth, what can happen economically when we lack democracy? Well, in California, once the blues succeeded in destroying democracy and turning it into a one party state where the Party always won, the looting of the public trough truly began in earnest. The abolition of competitive multiparty elections after 2010 is why Californians got $100B nonexistent trains:\n\n(6) Sixth, even in those contexts where the voting is more with feet than ballot, the essential principle of consent is preserved. For example, tech companies do have CEOs, and so there is top-down leadership. But they also have bottom-up consent, as every single person who's there has consented to be there and can leave at any time. This consent is what drives the performance of tech.\n\n(7) Seventh, the recent 97%+ vote in Starbase shows that we can manifest this type of consent in the physical world as an official vote, by combining voting with your feet (moving to Starbase), voting with your wallet (building Starbase), and then voting with your ballot (incorporating Starbase).\n\n(8) Eighth, just like crony capitalism isn\u2019t a good reason to implement communism, so too democratic corruption isn\u2019t a good reason to implement dictatorship.\n\n(9) Basically: I do understand the right\u2019s critique of democracy, just as I understand the left\u2019s critique of capitalism, but at the end of the day one must earn legitimacy through consensual votes just as one builds wealth through mutually beneficial transactions.\n\nOtherwise the right-wing anti-democrat is just the inverse of the left-wing anti-capitalist. The anti-capitalist wants wealth without earning it, while the anti-democrat wants legitimacy without building it.\n\nBut in reality there are no shortcuts. You need the consent of free people, freely given, to build something truly great. And that\u2019s what democracy really represents: the consent of the governed.\n\nAnyway, I'll write more on this, but we should reclaim democracy as we reclaimed free speech, by strengthening it for the Internet age. Because the alternative to democratic capitalism is communist dictatorship, and that just isn\u2019t an acceptable alternative.",

  "2025-06-05|Sympathetic to this argument, but a few points.  (": {
    "id": "1930671977184006633",
    "fullText": "Sympathetic to this argument, but a few points.\n\n(1) Minimum necessary legal innovation. First, just to clarify, new cities should not be \"free of regulation.\" They should inherit the existing legal code, and just make a few very carefully thought through changes. For example, perhaps you set up a self-driving zone where all cars must be self-driving cars. But otherwise you keep the existing legal code.\n\nJust that one change \u2014 all cars self-driving \u2014 will have so many ripple effects that it'll lead to a totally different physical environment, and all kinds of new businesses setting up there. But you don't need to change the laws on (say) littering. Laws tend to reflect balances arrived at over decades or even centuries, and you don't need to do everything de novo.\n\n(2) Start small, think big. Also, yes, America used to be a better place to build. But to fix it you can't fix the whole thing at once. You have to pick one small patch and fix it first, and then scale up your success from there. Just like a tech startup. This is easy to say, and extremely hard to do, which is why people fight at the federal level for one quick switch to flip. But you can't get back to the economy and demographics of 1945 with 45% tariffs. It just doesn't work like that. There is no quick fix. You have to prove, then expand.\n\n(3) Frontier cities. Another point is that frontier cities aren't really the same as special cities. Not to nitpick, but the term \"special city\" implies that it's somehow better than all the other cities. In reality, a frontier city will often be worse than existing cities on most dimensions \u2014 other than the key dimension of permitting a new innovation. For example, the hypothetical self-driving car city in the first example will likely lack the bagels of New York, or the beaches of Miami, and so on. It will only be better for those who want to build a self-driving city as a model for the world. And also, it won't start out as a city at all \u2014 it'll look more like a town (maybe) or a few streets. \n\n(4) Consensual cities. One other point I'd make is that Starbase is a better model than designating some existing location to be a startup city. If you do it from scratch in some previously godforsaken area, like Starbase, there is both much less resistance *and* much higher levels of consent. Every single person who's in Starbase has, to first order, voted with their feet, their wallet, and their ballot to build a new city. It's all about the consent of the governed. That's how you reclaim democracy, like reclaiming free speech. This kind of opting-in to new experiments is actually also part of the US tradition, namely the laboratory of the states.\n\nAnyway, just some practical points to keep in mind. Also useful for building new communities outside the US, of course.",

    "id": "1925197579715026977",
    "fullText": "Another day, another journo.\n\nToday it\u2019s a guy named Ali Breland. He\u2019s been spamming our members for months, because the oligarch Laurene Powell Jobs is paying him to write a hit piece on our startup society.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the specific angle he was tasked with writing about, and how our hard numbers completely disprove his journo rumors.\n\nThen let\u2019s go through the general context of why he was assigned to write this fake piece in the first place.\n\nWe'll end with the obvious observation that an Atlantic that abolished the police and bombed the Middle East actually has no moral standing whatsoever \u2014 and certainly cannot stop the free people of the world from pursuing our God-given right to self-determination by peacefully building new societies.\n\nHARD NUMBERS > JOURNO RUMORS\nFirst, the specifics. Ali was assigned to harass us using a common journo tactic one might call \u201cTrouble in Paradise.\u201d That\u2019s when the journo finds a few people you had to let go, puts their worst-sounding complaints under a magnifying glass, and then uses those distorted outliers to tar the entire organization.\n\nNow, for years, the way journos did this was to baselessly accuse people of rayyycism. They could usually find some party claiming you had secret bigotry, and failing that they\u2019d just manufacture an accusation themselves. And indeed that\u2019s exactly the line Ali pursued on a different company, as you can see from his past unsolicited DM to me in 2023:\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t just this DM. Given that he\u2019s a journo, Ali has falsely accused many things of being rayyyycist over the years. A partial list of things he\u2019s tarred as Nazi-adjacent include NFTs, e/acc, Telegram, Gamestop, AMC, DeSantis, Elon, Reddit, and even Silicon Valley itself.\n\nBut calling everything rayyyycist isn\u2019t as effective anymore, and it\u2019s particularly ineffective on another brown guy like me, so Ali had to come up with a new angle: rather than secret bigotry, he\u2019d accuse us of being secretly unhealthy! Behold the message he\u2019s been spamming to our community members since at least Jan 2025:\n\nNote the part about \u201cmold\u201d. That\u2019s meant to sound bad. Except it\u2019s completely misleading. Because mildew in Southeast Asia is as common as sand in the Sahara or frost in Canada. It\u2019s just a common building maintenance issue in Singapore\u2019s humid climate, and present even in beautiful new places like Nanyang Technological University:\n\nWith that context, you can understand what actually happened: we rented several buildings in late September, we heard about spots of mildew a few weeks later in October, and we hired a top Singapore firm to remediate it out of an abundance of caution. Their professional opinion was that it was just cosmetic with zero health implications. I\u2019ve attached their letter below:\n\nIn addition to this expert opinion stating no health issue, we looked at the instrumental record of air quality measurements across the facility from our dehumidifiers and air purifiers. The absolute worst reading we got was well within the normal range of Los Angeles air, and of course the average air quality was much better than LA on average.\n\nSo: that\u2019s a fatality for Ali\u2019s fake story. Because when journos accuse you of racism, there isn\u2019t a geiger counter for bigotry. There\u2019s no numerical way to prove yourself innocent of their false accusations. But because there\u00a0is\u00a0a geiger counter for air quality, we can prove ourselves innocent of the charge that there was any health issue. \n\nEssentially: against mere journo rumors, we have\u00a0hard numbers. So Ali will have to give up his attempted cosplay as a molecular epidemiologist, and return to his original job of accusing people of rayyycism in his capacity as a fake news journalist.\n\nBy the way, this is exactly how Elon knocked down a fake NYT story that claimed Tesla cars ran out of charge on the side of the road. He proved the NYT journo was faking the story, because he had the instrumental record.\n\nSimilarly, we too have the instrumental record of air quality measurements from all our IoT devices. And now that they\u2019ve been informed that both expert opinion and on-the-ground quantitative measurement detected no health issues whatsoever, any attempt by Ali and his oligarchic bosses at the Atlantic to defame our startup society could be considered actual malice\u2026with all the consequences that entails for their media corporation.\n\nBut why do these oligarchs want to defame us in the first place? For that let's go to tweet #2:",

That established an exchange rate of slightly less than 0.1 US cents per BTC. See the quoted tweet.\n\n[2] Today, on May 21 2025, the price of 1 BTC hit an all time high of $109,767.52 in USD.\n\n[3] To work out the monthly compounding rate:\n\nLet m=187 months btwn Oct 12, 2009 & May 21 2025\n\n Let  r=($109,767.52/1)/($5.02/5050), roughly 110-million-fold over that time frame.\n\nTo find the compounding rate x such that (1+x)^m = r, you can take logs and get x = exp(ln(110e6)/187)-1, which gets you x = 10.41%.\n\n[4]: Future historians will need to teach their students that the transition from USD to BTC didn't actually happen immediately, even if it will seem instant on a historical scale. As soon as the hardest money around returned to the scene, the USD began to collapse in value against BTC.\n\nThere's really only one more order of magnitude to go. You can't even see it on this chart, but we'll see it in real life.",

    "id": "1925200434979049588",
    "fullText": "More important than any story is the story behind the story.\n\nSo: why? Why would the Atlantic pay a guy for literally months to spam our members about a year-old maintenance non-issue on a building ten thousand kilometers away from their HQ in DC? I mean, there are more important things happening in the world.\n\nAnd it is puzzling at first. But then it isn\u2019t once you realize that the life\u2019s work of Atlantic owner Laurene Powell Jobs is destroying American cities, while the life\u2019s work of Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg is destroying foreign cities \u2014 and so they absolutely hate anyone building up new cities outside their control.\n\nAfter all, remember that Laurene Powell Jobs helped abolish the police, and thereby turned Blue America into a place where you can be stabbed on the street, shot in the back, set on fire, and pushed in front of a train. Further recall that the air in Los Angeles, the water of Detroit, and the very ground of San Francisco has become hazardous to human health thanks to the rampant wildfires, arsons, drug addicts, syringes, and feces caused by the comprehensive failures of progressive governance \u2014 by the failures that Powell Jobs strongly lobbied for, while remaining personally insulated from the disastrous consequences:\n\nMoreover, remember that Jeffrey Goldberg helped mislead America into Iraq, and pushed for every forever war since then, thereby turning much of the Middle East into a place where you can be blown up by shrapnel, vaporized by drones, sold into slavery, or beheaded by ISIS. Further recall that the air in Iraq, the water in Yemen, and the very ground of Libya has become hazardous to human health thanks to saturation bombing, improvised explosive devices, and civil wars caused by the comprehensive catastrophe that is neocon ideology \u2014 a catastrophe that Jeffrey Goldberg vociferously advocated for, while remaining personally insulated from the murderous consequences:\n\nSo now it becomes more clear. This is their life\u2019s work! Literally the life\u2019s work of the woke nepotist Laurene Powell Jobs and the neocon warmonger Jeffrey Goldberg is creating deadly hazards to human health.\n\nBecause they spent their lives ruining both American cities and foreign cities. Whether it\u2019s the Middle East or the West Coast, they initiated pointless invasions and imported arsonist illegal aliens, until the skies of both Syria and Southern California were filled with poisonous soot as the buildings caught aflame. That is the Atlantic\u2019s ideology: abolish the police, and destroy the Middle East.\n\nObviously, we stand against that.\n\nWe stand against the Atlantic because we can stand up to media corporations. I mean, Ali writes constantly about white power, but the proles he piles on are the white powerless. Actual white power is Laurene Powell Jobs, and actual white power is Jeffrey Goldberg. They have power over a slave like Ali, but no power over BTC. They hate us because they ain\u2019t controlling us.\n\nWe stand against the Atlantic because we have built a truly global movement. Our community includes people from dozens of US cities and 100+ nations \u2014 including the cities which Laurene Powell Jobs flooded with aliens, and the nations where Jeffrey Goldberg pushed for invasions.\n\nAnd we stand against the Atlantic because we stand for something stronger than an irredeemably corrupt US establishment of oligarchs and neocons. We stand instead for the ancient principle of self-determination, the idea that anyone should be able to found new communities without interference from the likes of Goldberg and Powell.\n\nPerhaps you will stand with us.\nIf so, you should come to Network School.",

It\u2019s Ben Smith, the guy who published the fake Steele Dossier. He\u2019s writing about a 300+ person group chat that I sometimes post in, along with a bunch of other people.\n\nOne recent chat was with my friend @JTLonsdale. Now, Joe and I have known each other for 20 years, we\u2019ve co-invested on many deals, and we broadly share the same values around freedom, capitalism, technological progress, and the like.\n\nBut we did differ recently on the extent to which the US had tried to contain China.\n\nBroadly speaking, I think the US has always had an interest in remaining the #1 world power, and that it traded with China only because it felt it had many levers over the PRC in event of a dispute. By contrast, Joe felt that the US had been naive towards China until recently, at which point it came to its senses and realized China was never interested in playing win/win games.\n\nJoe thought I was being too sympathetic to the CCP view, because they do claim the US is trying to contain them. I said an unchecked CCP would indeed be very nasty, and that\u2019s why the US was actually right to try to contain them. And basically we came to agreement in the DMs and moved on. Which is of course how all men who aren't NPCs operate: you debate things, sometimes you have a difference of opinion, and you move on as friends.\n\nYeah. I know.

  "2025-04-26|INDIA'S VENGEANCE IS BEST SERVED COLD The single b": {
    "id": "1916056133078552750",
    "fullText": "INDIA'S VENGEANCE IS BEST SERVED COLD\nThe single biggest mistake of the century was America's response to Pakistan-backed fundamentalist terrorism. And it happened in three acts.\n\n(1) First came Bush, the anti-terror president, who overreacted to terrorism by starting a giant series of wars.\n\n(2) This led to Obama, the antiwar president[1], who overreacted to war by starting a giant surge in woke[2].\n\n(3) This in turn led to Trump, the anti-woke president, who is now reacting to woke by ending[3] a giant empire.\n\nAnd this whole series of events was due in large part to Pakistan. Because Osama bin Laden was based in Pakistan, just down the street from the Pakistan Military Academy!\n\nRemember, America had everything going for it on September 10, 2001. It was the world's dominant hyperpower. But Osama bin Laden and Pakistan successfully baited the US into wasting its blood and treasure on war, distracting America from the rise of China[4], and thereby kicking off the series of events that brought us to the present day.\n\nSo: India should learn from America's mistakes. It should not take the bait of Pakistani terrorism. It should instead play its own game, and coldly neutralize Pakistan by aligning the world against it.\n\nHere's what that could look like.\n\nWHAT INDIA CAN DO\nFirst, what should Bush have done? In retrospect, he should have stopped fundamentalist immigration into all NATO countries, avoided war in favor of surgical counterterrorism, and targeted Wahhabism at the root by backing domestic anti-fundamentalists like Mohammed bin Salman[5].\n\nThat would have neutralized the terrorist threat without waging a giant war. And that is what India can do in response to Pakistan's bait. \n\nIN THE SHORT RUN\nLet's divide India's possible strategy into short run, medium run, and long run actions. In the short run, India should:\n\n(a) Stop the immediate threat. 99% of security is border security. So the smart first step for India is to do what they've just done[6]: namely, temporarily suspending issuance of visas to Pakistani nationals, asking those still within India to leave, and securing the border.\n\nWhile this policy will regrettably impact the many Pakistani nationals who aren't fundamentalists, it is essentially nonviolent. And it addresses the immediate situation by making it hard for Pakistan to execute followup attacks within India.\n\n(b) Begin surgical counterterrorism. The next step is to hunt down the gunmen within Kashmir and then begin surgical counterterrorism. No doubt this is already happening, but the basic point is that invisible special operations are the appropriate mirror to deniable terrorist attacks. That is: retaliation should look more like pagers[7] than bombers.\n\nIN THE MEDIUM RUN\nWith the border secured and counterterrorism initiated, India's next step should be to isolate the Pakistan regime economically and diplomatically by cutting off its support from the US and EU/UK.\n\n(a) Incentivize the US to stop arming Pakistan. Somehow America is still sending money to Pakistan[8], as a relic of Cold War-era policy. The latest episode involved the release of $397M (!) for some sort of bizarre program to monitor the use of Pakistani F-16s for counterterrorism. \n\nObviously: F-16s aren't useful for counterterrorism, Pakistan shouldn't have F-16s, Pakistan intends to use those F-16s against India, the $397M sent to Pakistan will be stolen, and the program as a whole just helps prop up the prestige of the Pakistani army.\n\nInstead, India should ask the US to just shut down all funding for Pakistan, the country that harbored bin Laden. That saves the US money, it's in America's national interest, and India is a better customer anyway.\n\n(b) Incentivize the EU/UK to stop trading with Pakistan. India has a long history with the UK and billions in trade with the EU. All parties want a trade deal given current circumstances. So India can ask the EU/UK to freeze out Pakistan[9] in return for more market access. If it really needs to sweeten the pot, India does have some influence over Russia[10] \u2014 so India can offer to help bring peace to Ukraine in return for EU/UK sanctions on Pakistan.\n\nIN THE LONG RUN\nNow for the hard part. India's strategic goal with Pakistan should actually be regime change, with the goal of deniably installing a non-fundamentalist leader like Ataturk/MBS/MBZ/Reza Shah Pahlavi/Zahir Shah[11-15] who can keep the lid on.\n\nBut this can't be done through a Bush-style invasion, both because that'll wreck India's economy and because Pakistan has ~250M people and nuclear weapons.\n\nFortunately, there are other mechanisms for regime change. And in Pakistan's case, the key lever may be Chinese money and Gulf oil rather than the Indian military.\n\nNO WAR, JUST OIL\nAs background, China is Pakistan's number one backer[16], in part because China and India are rivals in many ways. But China needs oil more than it opposes India.\n\nAnd that could be the key to flipping China on Pakistan. You see, China is trying to build a pipeline[17] through Pakistan to pump oil from the gulf:\n\nBut fundamentalist psychos in Pakistan keep launching attacks on that very corridor, including one in October[18] that killed multiple Chinese nationals:\n\nMoreover, China and India have a shared interest in stopping fundamentalism in Central/South Asia, because it's been a huge issue for China too since at least the 2014 Kunming[19] stabbings.\n\nSo: India could make the case to China (and the Gulf states!) that they should cooperate to nonviolently support anti-fundamentalist factions in Pakistan. Then China gets all the oil they need, the Gulf gets all the money they want, and India gets all the peace they deserve.\n\nHow would this work?\n\nWell, Turkey had Ataturk[10], and Saudi had MBS[11], and the UAE had MBZ[12], and neighboring Iran had Reza Shah Pahlavi[13], and neighboring Afghanistan had Zahir Shah[14]. Moreover, India is friendly[20] with the Gulf states, which it trades with quite a bit.\n\nSo it's not completely crazy to imagine that by combining China's economic influence, the Gulf's cultural influence, and India's political intelligence that they could eventually back a Pakistani faction willing to just crush the fundamentalists, pump the oil, and stop the infiltrations.\n\nYes, Pakistan's Army is the ultimate king-maker, but they are resource-constrained. In particular, if India can get the US to stop sending military aid to Pakistan, and the EU/UK to stop trading with Pakistan, it starts to seriously reduce the amount of money the Pakistani regime has without Chinese/Gulf support.\n\nAnd that may open up room for alternative factions within the Pakistani regime \u2014 factions that like money more than they like terrorism.\n\nIN SUMMARY\nTo be clear, I'm not saying this specific strategy to get China to flip on Pakistan is guaranteed to work, though I think it's worth trying.\n\nI am however saying that the general concept of going upstream to cut off US/UK/EU/Chinese/Gulf support for the Pakistani regime is the right line of attack \u2014 as opposed to taking the bait like America did after 9/11.\n\nRemember: like America in 2001, today's India has everything going for it. It has the fastest growing large economy in the world. It has UPI, Jio, dozens of tech unicorns, and a young, rising population that's optimistic about the future. It is even landing probes on the dark side of the moon!\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan has nothing going for it. It is a fundamentalist basketcase wracked by coups. In its envy and malevolence, it seeks to drag India down to its own level and pull it into endless war, followed by internal division and distraction. Just like bin Laden did to America.\n\nBut India can learn from America's mistakes. It can surgically respond in the short run with secure borders and deniable special operations, rather than all-out war. It can economically respond in the medium run by cooperating with the US and EU/UK to cut off Pakistan. And it can strategically respond in the long run by aligning China and the Gulf to install a stable, secular faction within Pakistan who will just crush fundamentalism and pump gas.\n\nThat's what strategic victory looks like. And that's how India can avoid taking Pakistan's bait in favor of calmly neutralizing Pakistan as a threat. This vengeance is best served cold.",

So he increasingly stressed race (eg Ferguson) and especially gender (the \"War on Women\" was a key feature of his campaign). \n\nSee: https://t.co/Rco5XDcEOq\n\n[3] Many conservatives are persuaded by the Buchanan concept of a \"republic, not an empire\". I've written about how the end of American Empire may not go as they expect; so has Niall Ferguson:\nhttps://t.co/kIfiW7p7Hb\n\n[4]: \"9/11 offered what Beijing defined as a 'window of strategic opportunity' to develop its strength while the United States was acutely distracted.\"\nhttps://t.co/QanAON7pTf\n\n[5]: Saudi Arabia has radically changed under MBS. He's purged the fundamentalists and is much more of a technocrat. This is now being more widely acknowledged, even in the West. See eg: https://t.co/ZRxsx9lK9j\n\n[6]: https://t.co/Z6SX6QtZ4B\n\n[7]: War is an ugly business, but if you absolutely must fight it's best to be as targeted as possible.\n\n[8]: https://t.co/hSFh0tJusX\n\n[9]: The EU is one of Pakistan's largest trading partners: https://t.co/QN2asajAKr\n\n[10]: There's a Rube Goldberg machine running right now where Europe buys oil from India, who in turn buys oil from Russia, so that Europe doesn't buy it directly from Russia: https://t.co/9lmTiNAPVZ\n\nIndia certainly can't stop Putin's war by itself, but it does have some influence with Russia, and perhaps it could lean in on the Ukraine peace deal if the EU genuinely cuts off Pakistan.\n\n[11]: Ataturk famously built a secular Turkey, even if that's arguably being reversed today: https://t.co/i7MLMWyvGM\n\n[12]: MBS pulled Saudi away from fundamentalism: https://t.co/ZRxsx9lK9j\n\n[13]: MBZ ensured the UAE was technocratic rather than fundamentalist. See for example this clip by UAE Foreign Minister bin Zayed: https://t.co/XHGAZ9OaSj\n\n[14]: Jimmy Carter undercut the Shah, leading to the Islamic Revolution. But before 1979, this is what Iran looked like: https://t.co/B2POrhpZdG\n\n[15]: Under Zahir Shah, Afghanistan had schools and colleges for girls. But then Afghanistan turned communist and eventually fundamentalist. A dark regression:\nhttps://t.co/gRKhMeiXiE\n\n[16]: China is in many ways Pakistan's number one patron. For example, 82% of Pakistani arms come from China: https://t.co/zYgXVuXKZT\n\n[17]: There is a whole website and everything for the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor), including the proposed pipeline from Gwadar to Kashgar: https://t.co/kXxrXMNYy6\n\nSee also this SCMP article: https://t.co/aMRoseYehv\n\n[18]: Chinese nationals keep getting blown up by fundamentalists within Pakistan, which is of course completely irrational from the Chinese perspective given that they are paying Pakistan:\n\nhttps://t.co/IF5M6sFFIl\n\nIndia may be able to press this point to get China to stop funding Pakistan in the same way. They probably won't flip China entirely, but getting China to simply back a Pakistan faction that doesn't support terrorism is in both India and China's interests \u2014\u00a0as well as the Gulf states that want to pump oil, as well as the interests of most of the people in Pakistan.\n\n[19]: https://t.co/ZFoDUTp9di\n\n[20]: India and the Gulf states do a lot of business together nowaday, particularly India and the UAE, where there's a large Indian diaspora and even now a large Hindu temple. These are broadly speaking increasingly pragmatic, technocratic countries that oppose fundamentalism: https://t.co/lp65yG11Fd",

And so on.\n\nSo, the American right stopped listening. And stopped feeling shame or empathy. Especially for those outside the tribe.\n\nBut that was an overreaction too. Because most non-Americans are really not enemies. They're just neutral or even friendly business partners.\n\nAnd without empathy for their position, for the very real costs these sudden random illogical tariffs imposed on them, the American right won't understand what comes next.\n\nFor example, they won't understand why the 190+ countries attacked via the tariffs aren't going to leap to America's side vs China. Quite the contrary.\n\nAnd they won't understand why the tariffs are more like lose/lose than win/lose let alone win/win, because the US will face shortages of machine tools, medical supplies, and perhaps even food if they continue.\n\nAnyway. Without understanding another man's negotiating position, without walking a mile in his shoes and thinking about how he can benefit too, you can't get to a win/win deal. That's why empathy is valuable even for cold-blooded capitalists.",

But when you add them up, you have double digit support for many simultaneous kinds of insanity. This just wasn't the case in the America of, say, 2007.\n\nSo,  taken in its totality, if you're a businessman from a neutral third party country like Hungary or South Korea, is the US now as attractive a place to do business as it was even a decade ago? Do you want to hold dollars and base your company in the US and buy/sell from the US and send your kids to school in the US?\n\nProbably not. That businessman may be forced to rebase around China as the global hub for logistics, whether they like it or not. And they'll have to rely increasingly on the Internet (including Bitcoin) as the actual mechanism for enforcing a \"rules-based order\" that even China has to respect.\n\nBut that doesn't mean globalization comes to a halt. It just means that the US abandons the wave of globalization it set in motion. And as it steps down, it names China and the Internet as the competing successors to American Empire.",

    "id": "1908236239268175927",
    "fullText": "Ironically, one symptom of deindustrialization is that many commenters have never actually managed a physical business.\n\nSo. Suppose your US company imports $1M of high quality parts, and adds in its own components to produce finished goods sold for $1.2M per batch. Your gross profit is $200k per batch.\n\nBut wait! Suddenly a new 30% tariff is imposed on that $1M of parts. You now have to fork over $300k to customs before you sell anything. That\u2019s cash you probably don\u2019t have. Oh, and even if you do sell everything, you\u2019re now losing $100k per batch.\n\nWith a sinking feeling, you realize your profitable business which you somehow managed to keep in America all these years has suddenly become unprofitable.\n\nYou post online about how bad this is but get shouted down by an angry mob, convinced that capitalists like you should die. You can\u2019t tell nowadays if they\u2019re on left or right.\n\nMoreover, you don\u2019t have the time, money, skills, or tools in house to build that $1M of parts yourself. You are being asked to do the equivalent of growing a maple tree when all you needed was a little maple syrup. So now you are faced with several tough choices. \n\n(1) First, you may need to go into debt or fire people to quickly come up with the $300k in cash to pay for these surprise tariffs at customs. Even if the tariff might go away, it might not, so you have to get the cash somehow or risk having your shipment impounded.\n\n(2) Next, you might need to reduce quality to stop losing $100k on each batch. You could order the lower quality $750k parts, grimace and pay 30% tariff at customs, and hope you can build and sell for the same price of $1.2M per batch despite the lower quality.\n\n(3) Alternatively, you could keep the quality parts at $1M and instead raise prices to $1.5M per batch to get back your original margins of $200k per batch, which you need to pay employees after all. But that\u2019s a big hike that your customer will probably not welcome, given that he\u2019s likely dealing with his own tariff shock.\n\nSo: these tariffs don\u2019t really give an incentive to build in the US. Because it\u2019s far more expensive to build a screw factory than to pay even high tariffs on a foreign screw.\n\nInstead what they likely mean is debt, layoffs, lower quality, and higher prices for any US company that buys parts abroad.\n\nJust to understand how common that is:",

    "id": "1908462608602325281",
    "fullText": "RATIONAL INDUSTRIAL POLICY\nThis is just theoretical at this point, but suppose a rational America wanted to wean itself off key Chinese exports in a surgical manner.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\n(1) First, get data on current US supply chains. Because the state is ready to compel, it should ask for import, customer, and vendor lists on corporate tax returns. It would require paperwork, but you could partially automate it by allowing companies to link their bank transaction data to a government website, and it\u2019s way cheaper than tariffs.\n\n(2) Equipped with the data on who each company is buying from and selling to, you get a visualization of the actual US supply chain in all its enormous complexity, like this but on a much larger scale:\n\n(3) Now you identify genuinely strategic areas. You do not care about French wine or Canadian maple syrup. You do care if the US military's vendor\u2019s vendors are located in China, as per this Pentagon-commissioned study:\n\n(4) For each foreign vendor in those areas, you gather ALL the customers of that vendor and determine what the capital cost and time would be to stand up a domestic facility capable of producing the components they need.\n\n(5) Suppose for example they all need a special kind of widget, and they collectively buy $30M per year from this foreign vendor, and the factory to create that widget will cost $100M and take a year to set up. They now pool their capital (likely with government assistance) to set up a US-based alternative, and gradually shift over their spend once it goes online in a year.\n\n(6) This is what incentive alignment looks like. It is in the national interest and ALSO their business interest to collectively crowdfund a new supplier, because a second domestic alternative would put price pressure on the foreign supplier!Moreover, their joint investment has the prospect of venture returns, especially if they all shift over their business. It\u2019s a public-private industry consortium, like Sematech in the 80s-90s, which is worth studying in detail (link in reply).\n\n(7) You parallelize this across many different foreign vendors, recognizing that some are too hard to tackle in your first pass. You use the money printer to strategically disburse cash whenever the customers can\u2019t collectively afford the $100M factory. But whenever you do this you take a stake for the state, so the people see an ROI.\n\n(8) There are already state level funds like CalPERS or the UT endowment that could be repurposed to do this. Or you set up a sovereign wealth fund. The main point is to get proven engineers, entrepreneurs, and investors making these capital allocation decisions, even if they\u2019re rewarded more with patriotic glory rather than money.\n\n(9) As you set them up, you recognize that not all of these new domestic suppliers will succeed, and moreover that not all of them will immediately succeed. It will take years and many of these consortia will fail.\n\n(10) But those that win allow you to then go one step up the value chain, moving key widget manufacturers onshore. You repeat this for the next set of foreign vendors, the ones you couldn\u2019t tackle in the first place.\n\n(11) At every step you ask whether this is more of a \u201cCanadian maple syrup on my pancakes\u201d issue or a \u201cChinese parts in my missile\u201d issue. You ignore the former because they\u2019re military allies and friends, and focus entirely on the latter.\n\nAnyway. That\u2019s how a rational country would do it. Get the data, focus on the most strategically important foreign suppliers, use public-private partnerships like Sematech to fund domestic alternatives, and then rinse and repeat as they succeed.",

    "fullText": "REFERENCES\n\n(1) Here's a good piece from 2011 on Sematech, which is part of how the US responded to the Japanese challenge. Unfortunately, I don't think today's America has the patience for something like this, because they want a quick fix with a button press.\n\nBut it is possible that some consortium of the EU, Canada, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and the like could do this to create second suppliers for key Chinese components:\nhttps://t.co/39wt9V0AIq\n\n(2) Regarding public-private partnerships, that is how the Chinese responded to the ASML sanctions. They set up a public-private partnership to collaborate on EUV lithography, they have a state-owned firm, they're funding multiple teams, and they're aligning incentives.\n\nhttps://t.co/Ix9owQb8mP\n\n(3) One potentially obvious point is that an international public-private consortium outside the US will need a neutral ground to hold the capitalization table and allow the global Internet to participate in it. There are various options for a new Switzerland that I won't get into here.\n\n(4) With that said, simply saying one will do a public-private partnership is like saying one will do venture capital. It is very easy to spend money and very hard to make quantifiable returns!\n\nThere are many details in the execution. Much of the time, a public-private partnership just turns into an excuse for graft, like the green jobs boondoggle of the last admin. And even when it isn't graft, the best guys still can't always pull them off, because coordination is hard.\n\n(5) Still: given that the goal is to compete with an Asian giant, one should at least understand (a) how America responded to the last Asian giant (Japan) with a chip consortium like Sematech, and (b) how China is responding to ASML with their own public-private consortia for EUV, and (c) how one might use the Internet to coordinate similar consortia to get second suppliers as alternatives to key Chinese vendors.",

    "fullText": "DOLLAR INFLATION IS GLOBAL TAXATION\n\nThere is just a fundamental misconception about what the USA actually is.\n\nIt is the seat of a global financial empire (or was). It makes its money by printing it. For example, it printed $1.25T for just one purchase back in 2010.\n\nDo you know many Nikes you\u2019d have to sell to make a trillion dollars?!?\n\nThe reason the American Empire had the right to print a trillion dollars at its whim is because it was managing the global financial system for everyone. So it had the right to impose global taxation via dollar inflation. Every time it printed $1T, that was divided by the 6B+ direct and indirect dollar holders worldwide, not just the 330M Americans.\n\nIn other words: the whole world paid the US to run the empire. And got diluted down (aka taxed) every time the US printed another dollar. That\u2019s why Milton Friedman said inflation is taxation without legislation.\n\nAnyway \u2014 the USA could impose global taxation via dollar inflation because it was a stable jurisdiction for multinational business, due to Delaware. It issued visas for scientists and workers from all over the world. It didn\u2019t have psychos bombing cars, shooting CEOs, or blocking roads. It advocated free trade, respected property rights, and only sanctioned rogue states.\n\nNow all that is gone. The US is no longer a neutral arbiter of the rules-based order that it once set up for its own benefit. And so it\u2019s going to lose that money-printing power. But before it goes, you should understand what it\u2019s losing.\n\nBecause the money-printing business model was way, way, way more profitable than working for a living. Yes, it had long-term negative consequences, but in the short and medium-term (meaning: multiple decades) it had absolutely no peer.\n\nExiting the money-printing business to return to the abandoned manufacturing business is likely not even possible because of the societal instability such a sharp decline in living standards will cause.\n\nAnyway, the people who ran American Empire could have spent this money more wisely. They could have taken far better care of their own citizens, and dropped fewer bombs on non-citizens. Then they wouldn\u2019t be at this juncture.\n\nBut *how* it spent the trillions is distinct from the indisputable fact that the US printed trillions in the first place. So the American Empire as an entity wasn\u2019t being ripped off by the world, especially by countries like Vietnam.\n\nMore the contrary.",

    "id": "1907008847681843250",
    "fullText": "This is partly tongue-in-cheek, but partly a real question. After all, North Koreans are not dumb. Next door China became strong under a nominally communist system. And South Korea's success, and the success of the Korean diaspora, shows that North Korea coulda been a contender.\n\nBut they're not. Why?\n\n(1) The obvious answer is because they're unreconstructed Stalinists, and of course I'd agree! But an intrinsic part of that Stalinism is not just an end to capitalism domestically, but an end to free trade with other countries.\n\n(2) OK, so could you do an internally capitalist autarky, which blocked all foreign trade with outsiders, yet practiced capitalism internally? I dunno. It's not obvious such a political entity can compensate for skills and materials located elsewhere on the globe in today's economy.\n\n(3) Maybe only China has the 1B+ scale to maybe pull off \"internally capitalist autarky\" in the modern global economy. And even they have an enormous demand for natural resources that's led them to sign deals with dozens of countries from Africa to Latin America.\n\n(4) Also, if you exert enough state control over an internally capitalist system by setting prices and imposing tariffs and doing \"industrial policy\", it becomes increasingly less capitalist.\n\n(5) And note that North Korea's juche policy sounds very similar to the rising economic nationalism. Namely: that North Koreans should only depend on goods made by North Koreans. And that even their next door neighbors were a potential threat.\n\n(6) In general, my view is that if you try to plunge a complex economy set up as the global hub of a financial empire into overnight autarky, the results won't be good.\n\nIt's similar to taking a banker who's ordered takeout for the last 50 years, blocking all roads to his house, and telling him to farm or die.\n\nYou may not get the farm part.",

Instagram filters required custom code; now all you need are a few keywords like \u201cStudio Ghibli\u201d or Dr. Seuss or South Park.\n\n(2) This changes online ads. Much of the workflow of ad unit generation can now be automated, as per QT below.\n\n(3) This changes memes. The baseline quality of memes should rise, because a critical threshold of reducing prompting effort to get good results has been reached.\n\n(4) This may change books. I\u2019d like to see someone take a public domain book from\nProject Gutenberg, feed it page by page into Claude, and have it turn it into comic book panels with the new ChatGPT. Old books may become more accessible this way.\n\n(5) This changes slides. We\u2019re now close to the point where you can generate a few reasonable AI images for any slide deck. With the right integration, there should be less bullet-point only presentations.\n\n(6) This changes websites. You can now generate placeholder images in a site-specific style for any <img> tag, as a kind of visual Loren Ipsum.\n\n(7) This may change movies. We could see shot-for-shot remakes of old movies in new visual styles, with dubbing just for the artistry of it. Though these might be more interesting as clips than as full movies.\n\n(8) This may change social networking. Once this tech is open source and/or cheap enough to widely integrate, every upload image button will have a generate image alongside it.\n\n(9) This should change image search. A generate option will likewise pop up alongside available images.\n\n(10) In general, visual styles have suddenly become extremely easy to copy, even easier than frontend code. Distinction will have to come in other ways.",

So the smarter route would be for MAGA to fix the empire piece-by-piece, by supporting conservatives and libertarians in Europe, by deregulating domestically, by making the minimum necessary enemies, and by redirecting that flow of printed money \u2014 rather than breaking up the whole empire in a negative-sum cloud of dust via tariffs and trade war. That just hands off the world to China, which is poised to pick up the pieces.\n\nAfter all, the American Empire is the greatest empire in human history, with 750 military bases across the globe, larger than even the British Empire at its peak. Shutting it down precipitously over the illusion that America is simply a \"country\" like any other will cause tremendous short- and medium-run damage to those in the seat of empire.",

    "id": "1903700743242326284",
    "fullText": "What happens if high quality AI models become free, ubiquitous, and inexpensive to run on even low-spec hardware?\n\n(1) First, you can rebuild every productivity app AI-first. That starts with Microsoft Word, Google Sheets, and Apple Keynote. But it extends to wholly new kinds of productivity apps.\n\n(2) Second, every \u201csmart\u201d device becomes truly smart. Your fridge can double as your nutritionist. Your alarm clock is your sleep therapist. And so on. Just like your car is already your driver.\n\n(3) Third, moats move to the app layer. As others have remarked, the GPT wrappers may end up more defensible than the GPT model itself.\n\n(4) Fourth, physicality becomes relatively more valuable. The hardware, the secure real estate, the in-person community \u2014 these are all things digital AI can\u2019t deliver.\n\n(5) Fifth, high human IQ actually becomes increasingly valuable. Because AI is really amplified intelligence rather than truly agentic intelligence, since it requires the creative prompt to get started.\n\n(6) Sixth, prompt engineering is here to stay, because prompting is programming \u2014 just in a higher-level language.\n\n(7) Seventh, the most common form of AI doomerism is proven false, because we are getting decentralized ubiquitous AI rather than centralized monotheistic AI. More like a garden of smart things than a vengeful Old Testament God that\u2019ll turn you into paperclips.\n\n(8) Eighth, the combination of cuts to US \u201cindustrialized\u201d academic research at the same time AI models accelerate discovery will mean a return to individual gentleman scientists and the advance of desci (decentralized science).\n\n(9) Ninth, the complement to probabilistic AI is deterministic crypto. For captchas, for identity, for money, for all these things \u2014 crypto is the digital scarcity that AI can\u2019t fake.\n\n(10) Tenth, the main cost of software development may reduce to reducing the costs of the physical environment. That is: to providing society-as-a-service, to simply giving engineers time to type and experiment in peace. This was already so, but may become even more so.\n\nSeveral of these points have been made by others, but I think that collectively they help define the second mover era.",

    "id": "1903469483739730132",
    "fullText": "AI OVERPRODUCTION\n\nChina seeks to commoditize their complements. So, over the following months, I expect a complete blitz of Chinese open-source AI models for everything from computer vision to robotics to image generation.\n\nWhy? I\u2019m just inferring this from public statements, but their apparent goal is to take the profit out of AI software since they make money on AI-enabled hardware. Basically, they want to do to US tech (the last stronghold) what they already did to US manufacturing. Namely: copy it, optimize it, scale it, then wreck the Western original with low prices.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll succeed.\nBut here\u2019s the logic:\n\n(1) First, China noticed that DeepSeek\u2019s release temporarily knocked ~$1T off US tech market caps.\n\n(2) Second, China\u2019s core competency is exporting physical widgets, more than it is software.\n\n(3) Third, China\u2019s other core competency is exporting things at such massive scale that all foreign producers are bankrupted and they win the market. See what they\u2019re doing to German and Japanese cars, for example.\n\n(4) Fourth, China is well aware that it lacks global prestige as it\u2019s historically been a copycat. With DeepSeek, becoming #1 in AI is now something they actually consider possibly achievable, and a matter of national pride.\n\n(5) Fifth, DeepSeek has gone viral in China and its open source nature means that everyone can rapidly integrate it, down to the level of local officials and obscure companies. And they are doing so, and posting the results for praise on WeChat.\n\n(6) Finally, while DeepSeek was obscure before recent events, it\u2019s now a household name, and the founder (Liang Wengfeng) has met both with Xi but also the #2 in China, Li Qiang. They likely have unlimited resources now.\n\nSo, if you put all that together, China thinks it has an opportunity to hit US tech companies, boost its prestige, help its internal economy, and take the margins out of AI software globally (at least at the model level).\n\nThey will instead make their money by selling inexpensive AI-enabled hardware of increasing quality, from smart homes and self-driving cars to consumer drones and robot dogs.\n\nBasically, China is trying to do to AI what they always do: study, copy, optimize, and then bankrupt everyone with low prices and enormous scale.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll succeed at the app layer. But it could be hard for closed-source AI model developers to recoup the high fixed costs associated with training state-of-the-art models when great open source models are available.\n\nLast, I agree it\u2019s surprising that the country of the Great Firewall is suddenly the country of open source AI. But it is consistent in a different way, which is that China is just focused on doing whatever it takes to win \u2014 even to the point of copying partially-abandoned Western values like open source, which seemed like the hardest thing to adopt.\n\nOn that point: they did build censorship into the released DeepSeek AI models, but in a manner that\u2019s easily circumvented outside China. So, you might conclude they don\u2019t really care what non-Chinese people are saying outside China in other languages, so long as this doesn\u2019t \u201cinterfere with China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\nAnyway \u2014this is an area I\u2019ve been watching, and my reluctant conclusion is that China is getting better at software faster than the West is getting better at hardware.",

    "fullText": "TRIBALIST > NATIONALIST VS GLOBALIST\nThe common nationalist-vs-globalist framework is at best imperfect and at worst fundamentally incorrect. Because red and blue are really two Internet tribes, simultaneously sub-national and supra-national.\n\n\ud83d\udd34Let's take the red tribe first.\n\nI have some sympathy for them. But what does the ostensible Red American nationalist do when they wake up? They aren't usually walking down their street in a pro-American parade, or hanging out in their local community. They're angrily posting on the global Internet because they feel (with some justification) that their community has been destroyed by their fellow Blue Americans.\n\nIn other words: they're using the Internet to fight their fellow citizens while (implicitly) gaining followers and upvotes from foreign citizens. That means they're simultaneously a sub-national tribe (~50% of the US) and a supra-national entity (with millions of Internet followers around the world).\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Now, what about the blue tribe?\n\nThe ostensible globalist isn\u2019t really concerned with the globe at all, or with truly universal values, but with their own particular Blue American tribe \u2014 and their very local war against the Red American tribe.\n\nMoreover, when push comes to shove, Democrats too have a tradition to draw on to identify themselves as the true representatives of the American nation, of equality and justice and all that jazz, of values that really do date back to the founding (even if you'd argue they've been subverted).\n\nYes, it's true that Democrats pull more allies from around the globe than Republicans, or did until recently, but they aren't really universalists because they've built who/whom into their politics. They're just blue tribalists, and opposed to all outside their tribe.\n\n\ud83e\udd1c TLDR: you just don't come to correct conclusions if you think about it as \"nationalist\" vs \"globalist.\"\n\nBecause reds make crucial, daily use of the global Internet, with allies & followers across borders. And blues absolutely also make a claim to being the true representatives of the American nation.\n\nThus, red-vs-blue is not really nationalism vs globalism. It is at its core about tribalism-vs-tribalism.",

    "fullText": "FROM MAGA TO CHINA\nHere are four things MAGA is getting wrong, and why it's handing over the world to China.\n\n(1) First, MAGA correctly understands that America\u2019s economic position is in decline but thinks this is due to economic competition itself, rather than lack of competitiveness.\n\n(2) Second, MAGA also understands that the US has wasted trillions abroad in foreign wars, but thinks the problem is global leadership itself rather than poor leadership.\n\n(3) Third, MAGA knows that their Blue American enemies have allies abroad, but has incorrectly overreacted to this by treating every non-Red-American as an enemy.\n\n(4) Fourth, MAGA sees the billions of dollars flowing from the US to foreign recipients, but isn't grasping that the US can only print those dollars in the first place so long as it's the hub of a global empire.\n\nWhen you put these together you can both understand MAGA's actions and understand why they will not lead to the intended result.\n\nBasically: MAGA is hyperfocused on cutting off any apparent flow of funds from Red Americans to Blue Americans and non-Americans. And they only have ~500 days in power. So they're trying to quickly shut off imports, close down institutions, and exit all wars.\n\nOK.\n\nExcept the reason the imports exist in the first place is because US products aren't competitive relative to Chinese products (or Fed printing). The reason those institutions exist is because the US set them up to run the world. And the reason those wars are happening is not because of American leadership per se, but because of the absence of good leadership.\n\nIf you shut all of that down at once \u2014\u00a0if you abandon global competition and global leadership \u2014 you shut down American Empire, and with it the ability to print money. And then everyone in that empire has a very bad time.",

    "fullText": "Unfortunately, the US Navy has been decisively defeated in the Red Sea. You can see it from the IMF Portwatch graph:\n\nThis has been clear since Biden announced the failed Operation Prosperity Guardian in late 2023. The US now lacks the combined military and diplomatic strength to stop the Houthi blockade, for structural reasons that will be difficult for the Trump administration to reverse. Let's go through a few of them:\n\n(1) Technological disruption of the Pentagon. First, the Houthis have 1/1000 the cost structure. They can counter $2M in US military spend with $2K in technology spend. This means the ~$800B Pentagon budget may not be as effective as we think. It could be like any lumbering big company with a big budget that can be disrupted by a startup with better cost effectiveness. Except this time the \"startup\" is a group of heavily armed fundamentalists.\n\n(2) Diplomatic disruption of the State Department. Second, the Chinese have been on a diplomatic offensive since early 2023, negotiating a Saudi/Iran  treaty (without US involvement!) that puts them at the pivot of the Middle East. This means China has leverage over Iran, who in turn has leverage over the Houthis:\n\n(3) Geopolitical disruption of the Red Sea. As a consequence, the Suez Canal is now de facto controlled by China, Russia, and Iran. Western ships can't get through, but the Houthis are allowing their allies through:\n\nThere are many other factors one could enumerate:\n\n- the high level of organization of the Houthis\n- the political capital spent dealing with Oct 7\n- the low appetite for US intervention in the region\n- the energy the US is already spending in Ukraine\n- the lack of US capability in domestic drone mfg\n- the failure of Navy initiatives like the LCS\n- the 200X+ Chinese advantage in shipbuilding\n- the level of fanatical Houthi commitment\n\nBut the net is that the Pentagon lacks the military might to cost-effectively stop the Houthis, and the State Department lacks the diplomatic influence to halt the shooting.\n\nThese are structural issues \u2014 rot that's set in for decades and generations \u2014 that the new administration will find difficult to fix. Fundamentally, undoing the Red Sea blockade isn't a matter of will, but of capability.\n\nWish it weren't so.",

  "2025-03-06|TEN POINTS ON TARIFFS Tariffs are not a good idea": {
    "id": "1897542165750014079",
    "fullText": "TEN POINTS ON TARIFFS\nTariffs are not a good idea for the US. Deregulation should be pursued instead. Here's why.\n\n(1) Tariffs only protect the home market. First, at best, tariffs protect the US home market. But China only sends ~16% of its goods to the US! So even Trump's 10% tariff doesn't phase them, because they are selling 84% to other countries:\n\n(2) Tariffs hurt allies. Next, as the US imposes tariffs on allies, they become less likely to abide by US-requested trade restrictions on China. For example, the Netherland is no longer classifying ASML machines as dual-use, opening them up for China.\n\n(3) Tariffs are small incentives at high costs. Third, tariffs are at best a small incentive on the margins to manufacture in the US. A producer might make more money over the long run if a tariff is sure to persist. But these huge tariffs keep blinking in and out, which is the worst of all worlds. The uncertainty means you can't plan on tariffs being there tomorrow, and the high cost means you can't ignore them when they are imposed today. Breaking supply chains in this way just wrecks anyone exporting or importing into the US.\n\n(4) Tariffs don't help exports. Once retaliatory tariffs are imposed, US companies become even less competitive abroad in the 100+ countries where American and Chinese products compete. In fact, US tariffs open the door for China to move into Western Europe, Canada, and Mexico \u2014 the only places it hasn't yet become the dominant trade partner:\n\n(5) Tariffs aren't specific. Remember, the US has a money printer! So it can just directly invest in specific industries it thinks are strategic, rather than adopting the extremely imprecise instrument of tariffs. Subsidizing alcohol to Canada is not strategic.\n\n(6) Tariffs aren't realistically autarkic. There are only 77M MAGA but almost 1B+ in the EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand combined. There is just no way that 77M MAGA can produce as much as that \"Golden Billion\" economic union set up at great expense over 80 years. If you push the world to make everything autarkically within a single country, then China wins \u2014 because it has 1B+ scale.\n\n(7) Tariffs are irrational nationalism. Relatedly, tariffs do not correctly implement the who/whom or friend/enemy distinction. MAGA should understand that many allies like @PierrePoilievre are non-American, while many declared enemies are Blue Americans. If you're alienating Canadian conservatives while subsidizing the American far left, you're doing it wrong:\n\n(8) Tariffs are a diplomatic loser. While the US is alienating economic allies, China is signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with dozens of countries. The PRC has ~25 signed and 18 more on the way.\n\n(9) Tariffs are an unnecessary fight. Given that Republicans already inherited a Hot War with Russia, a Cold War with China, and a Cold Civil War with Democrats...why open up completely new conflicts with Canada (!?)\n\n(10) Tariffs aren't deregulation. Finally, easing domestic regulation is far better for improving production than adding new regulations in the form of tariffs. Because deregulation doesn\u2019t cause retaliation, and it also unlocks new production. There is political will to deregulate, so why not do that?\n\nTLDR: don't increase regulation via tariffs. Deregulate instead.",

  "2025-03-05|THE SPECIAL ELON ZONE (SEZ) There's a simple way t": {
    "id": "1897336623798665265",
    "fullText": "THE SPECIAL ELON ZONE (SEZ)\nThere's a simple way to rebuild manufacturing in the US: just give @elonmusk control of a huge swath of land surrounding Starbase, Texas and allow him to set whatever regulations he wants.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1) First, sunset the regulations. America has talent. What it doesn't have is friendly regulations, particularly in terms of labor and environmental laws. But President Trump and Governor Abbott of Texas can use executive orders to remove obsolete laws at state and federal level. And for anything they can't remove, they can direct state and federal police to exercise discretion in terms of non-enforcement. Think of Starbase as a \"sanctuary city\", but for innovation \u2014 using leftist tactics in reverse.\n\n2) Then, allocate capital. With regulatory barriers down capital will likely flow freely. However, in the unlikely event it doesn't, then you can do government VC. Basically: Democrats gave $370B+ to John Podesta to waste on climate graft, so the precedent is already established. But Elon is a proven capital allocator. So have Treasury back up the truck to make Elon \u2014or his designates \u2014 the #1 VC in America. Obviate all charges of conflicts of interest by giving the US itself a large stake in any company that's funded, with significant distribution of funds to Texans themselves, while also recognizing that of course Elon's contacts will include some of the most technically competent people in the world \u2014 and they'll be operating companies in the zone. \n\n3) Ensure border security. Given the security risks Elon faces, he'll need border control. So you might designate the land surrounding Starbase to be a military base or something similar, so that he can fence it off and determine at his sole discretion who can enter. Similarly, ideally every single person in the zone has opted in to be there, so no one can complain about the pro-builder regulations.\n\n4) Proceed at the speed of physics. Finally, with all man-made barriers removed in the form of regulation and capitalization, Elon and his designates can move at the speed of physics \u2014 not permits. Perhaps the single most important thing they could build would be mass-produced Tesla humanoids, which (if successful) could in turn build everything else.\n\n5) Nail it, then scale it. Once there's traction, replicate the idea in other states, giving other proven founders like @PalmerLuckey their own special economic zones. I'm sure Florida and Ohio would want theirs after Texas proves it out.\n\nBasically, the idea of special economic zones has been proven around the world to unlock production. Since most of what you're doing is putting a line through regulations, it's cheap, fast, and likely to work. And if it does, you'll get more factories like this:",

    "id": "1895904737800946093",
    "fullText": "REPROGRAMMING THE TERMINATOR\nThere's another option: Republicans could reprogram American Empire rather than winding it down. Like reprogramming the Terminator.\n\nBecause if the US just cuts European countries loose after decades of Blue American indoctrination, those states won't necessarily become based on their lonesome. Instead, they'll likely become Chinese satellites \u2014\u00a0and indeed, this is already underway:\n\nSo, here's a sketch of what a reprogram-the-empire strategy could look like, for both Europe and the Five Eyes (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand):\n\n(1) New US country managers. First, swap out all Victoria Nuland-style neocons for Michael Anton-style realists. Basically, appoint a serious ambassador for each nation, what in tech we'd call a \"country manager.\"\n\n(2) New in-country leads. Second, determine who the best local conservative, libertarian, or nationalist is, like a Nigel Farage or Pierre Poilievre equivalent in each allied state. Also have a few backup candidates in the event your number one pick doesn't take office.\n\n(3) Organize a center-right coalition. Third, bring all these people to the White House for a photo shoot and joint declaration. Put the full power of X behind them. Spend political capital building up the center-right in each country. Focus on common interests like trade deals, strong borders, and traditional values.\n\n(4) Publish a co-signed agenda for each country. Have your US country manager and in-country lead collaborate on a joint document, to be published in both English and their local language(s), on what a conservative/nationalist/libertarian revival would look like in their country, and how both the US and their country would benefit. Have Americans who hail from these places comment positively on the new direction.\n\n(5) Support them to political victory and beyond. Now, back your in country leads to the hilt from the White House, both before and after they attain power. Revise the law as needed to make all this legal in both countries. Essentially, reverse the polarities on the US State Department and turn it into something which supports center-right people with common interests abroad, a bit like what Reagan did but modernized.\n\nWhy should Republicans consider this strategy?\n\nWell, there are only 77M MAGA vs 1.4B China. And when American Empire was done right, as it arguably was for the first ~70 years, it created peace and prosperity for its subjects.\n\nMoreover, the Russians under Gorbachev just messily dismantled their far-left empire, but the Chinese under Deng Xiaoping gradually reprogrammed theirs \u2014 and who's doing better today? The path of reprogramming usually beats the path of dismantling.\n\nAnyway, this path for reforming Europe specifically and American Empire in general might be impossible, given the circumstances. But one should at least consider reprogramming the Terminator.",

  "2025-02-28|Could USDC have been an ICO? No. I was surprised t": {
    "id": "1895510135348560339",
    "fullText": "Could USDC have been an ICO? No.\nI was surprised to see this post so I dug into my notes.\n\nOverview\nI realized Noah was referring to Circle\u2019s initial plan to launch USDC via Cayman ICO. But for obvious regulatory reasons, this path was a non-starter \u2014 and also why there was zero fiat support for USDC till Coinbase got involved.\n\nAfter Coinbase got involved, we cofounded/refounded CENTRE with Circle, set it up for fiat banking, put in ~$25M of clean non-ICO capital, and launched USDC on our exchange on Oct 23 2018.\n\nAnd that was the $0 to $1 moment:\n\nNow, to be clear, since that launch, Circle has been a phenomenal partner, and I give them full credit for driving much of the USDC ecosystem. They deserve their share of USDC proceeds, and Coinbase and Circle have done well together as cofounders.\n\nBut given that Noah poked both me and Coinbase a bit here, I'm going to set the record straight on one specific point: USDC in its[1] modern sense of a 1:1 fiat-backed stablecoin did not exist before Coinbase and would not exist without Coinbase.\n\nTHE DETAILS\nThe fundamental question is whether Circle\u2019s contemplated ICO[2] was a viable path for USDC in 2018. It was not, and here's why:\n\n(1) First, doing an interest-bearing[3] token sale (!) in 2018 would have introduced tremendous and unnecessary regulatory risk.\n\n(2) The only reason Circle was contemplating that risk was because it didn\u2019t have as much[4] capital as Coinbase.\n\n(3) But the enormous regulatory risk of an ICO would have scared away banks \u2014 and meant no fiat banking support for USDC.\n\n(4) And that would have killed the core value prop of USDC, which was to be 1:1 tradeable with USD.\n\n(5) Also, no fiat banking would mean users couldn\u2019t just click a button to exchange USD for USDC on Coinbase.\n\n(6) Basically, no fiat banking would have meant USDC was just another risky Tether[5] clone.\n\n(7) To be crystal clear: had it been funded by ICO, USDC would lack its core value proposition of being 1:1 backed by USD in a fiat bank account \u2014\u00a0and probably would have gotten shut down.\n\n(8) And that's why the legal work Noah mentions doing on the CENTRE consortium prior to our involvement was essentially throwaway. We didn't need a 1-member stub entity set up to do an ICO. Once Coinbase lawyers got engaged, we refounded the consortium on a solid legal basis \u2014 with no ICO.\n\n(9) In short, that means the entire fiat piece of USDC \u2014 the banking relationships, the $25M in clean non-ICO capital, and the user interface for converting USDC 1:1 to USD \u2014 was essentially entirely Coinbase. Yes, Circle OTC and Poloniex did exist, but Polo didn\u2019t have fiat banking, and I\u2019d be surprised if the two together were >10% of Coinbase's USDC volume.\n\n(10) Now, what about the other two pieces one might bring up \u2014\u00a0the thinking behind USDC prior to the 2018 launch, and the crypto piece?\n\n(11) Meaning zero offense, I don't think the intellectual work on stablecoins prior to the $0 to $1 moment was particularly important. USDT already existed so the idea of a stablecoin wasn't novel. The execution of actually getting a 1:1 fiat-backed stablecoin was novel, and that was Coinbase\u2019s contribution.\n\n(12) As for the crypto piece, I absolutely credit Circle for having a great audited smart contract in 2018 when that was hard to do. We could have coded our own, but it would have taken weeks/months of effort \u2014 and I look at that as Circle's main contribution.\n\nTHE SUMMARY\nAnyway, Noah to his credit acknowledges all this in his follow up[6] post:\n\n\"USDC doesn't happen without Coinbase involvement. TBH, you could have told us to pound sand and launch your own stable. Circle needed Coinbase more than Coinbase needed Circle because of distribution.\"\n\nI mean, yeah. \ud83d\ude42\nJust to close this out, here are some empirical facts:\n\n(a) USDC volume was ~$0 before Coinbase launch[7]\n(b) CENTRE was a stub entity with one member prior to us refounding it on non-ICO terms\n(c) Coinbase is listed as cofounder alongside Circle in the CENTRE docs\n(d) Coinbase put in ~$25M of clean non-ICO capital in lieu of ICO capital\n(e) Coinbase eliminated other unnecessary complexity, including an onchain voting proposal which would have been another regulatory/security attack vector\n(f) Coinbase\u2019s banking partners held the vast majority of funds\n(g) Most USDC volume happened on Coinbase\n\nSo: it is for this reason that \"every few months a Coinbase alum pops up and paints this image of Coinbase employees in a room with a blank whiteboard coming up with USDC.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because we provided the fiat guts, which were the essential part. The ICO version of USDC would never have gone anywhere, but the Coinbase/Circle collaboration did.\n\nAnd 100% of USDC traction occurred after \u2014 and only after \u2014 that partnership.\n\nAs postscript, I just want to say that success has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan. I like Noah, I\u2019m an investor in Eco, and I'm sure he did great work on the Circle legal team. I also recognize that Circle has contributed immensely to the USDC ecosystem since the Oct 2018 launch, and none of this should be interpreted negatively towards them.\n\nI'm just setting the record straight: USDC in its[1] modern sense of a 1:1 fiat-backed stablecoin did not exist before Coinbase and would not exist without Coinbase. USDC was a collaboration, and Coinbase was a cofounder.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n[1]: To be clear, what I'm saying is that prior to our involvement USDC specifically was not backed 1:1 by fiat. There were a few other now-smaller stablecoins like Paxos and TrueUSD that were backed by fiat. There were also algorithmic stables like DAI. But the largest stable was USDT, which was not provably backed 1:1 by fiat banking support. And that was who we were competing against.\n\n[2]: I am not against a modified version of ICOs in principle, like STOs with lockups or the like. But in practice, ICOs were regulatory death in 2018.\n\n[3]: Also, it took till 2022 for interest rates to rise, so USDC ICO participants would have been extremely antsy with zero returns for four years. Coinbase had patient non-ICO capital.\n\n[4]: The reason Circle didn't have capital is because it had exited the Bitcoin brokerage business in late 2016, and missed the big runup in crypto prices in 2017. That's understandable \u2014 this space is hard, and Circle did many other things well! \u2014 but the consequence was contemplating an ICO in 2018 to raise $20M rather than just doing it via traditional means.\n\n[5]: I have no beef with Tether, but they are offshore YOLO. By contrast, USDC was onshore so could not ICO.\n\n[6]: Link to Noah's followup in replies below.\n\n[7]: Link to Coinmarketcap in replies below. There might be some ghost volume for USDC test trades onchain before the Oct 23 2018 launch, but there was no public interface to buy/sell USDC on Coinbase.",

Stablecoins are hard enough without that.\n\nTLDR: USDC was a partnership. And the fiat part in particular doesn't exist without Coinbase.",

    "fullText": "I get why nationalists and socialists oppose empire. Socialists think the US is exploiting the world, while nationalists think the US is exploited by the world. \n\nAnd both actually have a point, on different dimensions, if you look through it from their respective lenses:\n\nHowever, what's missing is the center-left and center-right defense of American Empire. In part this is because even the existence of this empire is not acknowledged. Despite having 750 military bases and the headquarters of the UN in New York, there is the pretense that this all somehow happened by accident.\n\nBut becoming global #1 in every category does not happen by accident. Wertheim's book documents exactly how and when the decision was made to seek empire: in 1940, after the fall of France, when the US realized that if they didn't build an empire then the Nazis (or, later, the Soviets) would.\n\nHowever, unlike past empires, American Empire is a hidden empire \u2014 as Daniel Immerwahr points out. Unlike the British Empire, it's not referred to in explicitly imperial terms, even if countries are expected to obey DC and pay tribute by buying Treasuries. \n\nLike the Soviet Empire, it's ideological yet invisible. And like the B2 Stealth Bomber, enormous resources were spent obscuring the empire of democracy, like they were for the empire of communism.\n\nAnyway, this conversation is tricky because if you say \"empire\" then people instantly assume you're saying \"empire is bad.\"\n\nBut it's not always bad. Sometimes it's almost self-defense. Because power abhors a vacuum \u2014 and if you do decide not to play for world domination, you may well be dominated by the one who does.\n\nAnd that's the logic of empire.\n\nThis was understood generations ago. But today, neither left nor right fully appreciates what it took to build American empire. They just inherited it. They don't understand it.\n\nAmong other things, the far left doesn't realize that it required capitalism and trade. The nationalist right doesn't realize that it required democracy and allies.\n\nCombining these was the only way to build the multibillion-person global trade union that underpins the US dollar. You couldn't do that with 77M Trump voters or 75M Democrats alone. You need trade partners, you need allies.\n\nOtherwise, when you print $6T (as the US did from 2020-2022) it's spread not across 6B+ people worldwide but just ~330M Americans. Because inflation is taxation, that's a 95% drop in the effective tax base. You go from printing $1000/head to $20000/head, with all the obvious consequences.\n\nAnyway, I completely understand why many US factions are tired of these abstractions. Because this concrete empire doesn't seem to be working for them. What isn't being considered is that things may get even worse, at least temporarily, if empire is retired.\n\nI guess we'll see what happens.",

    "fullText": "Here's how USDC launched.\n\nIn mid-2018, Circle had an audited smart contract.\nBut they'd exited the exchange business in 2016.\nCoinbase, meanwhile, had capital & distribution.\nSo I flew to Boston and proposed a deal.\nWe set up the CENTRE consortium with Circle.\nAnd capitalized it with $25M in corporate funds.\n\nThe underlying idea behind USDC was simple.\nBack one USDC with one USD in a bank account.\nJust do 1:1 redemption.\nNo order book, no conversion risk, no games.\nNo volatile plutonium underlying a stablecoin.\nJust like withdrawing a dollar from an ATM...\nYou withdraw a dollar to the blockchain.\n\nBut executing that simple idea wasn't that easy.\nWe needed a banking partner to hold the USD.\nAnd we needed to code the smart contract integration.\nBoth nontrivial regulatory and security problems.\nEspecially in 2018.\n\nHowever, with two brilliant engineers (@maksim_s @mihar), one resourceful BD lead (@JimMigdal), and a PM with the soul of an artist (@js_horne) \u2014 we got it done.\n\nFrom $0 to $1.\nAnd then to $1B+ in interest income.\nWithin about five years.\n\nPretty awesome partnership with @jerallaire and his Circle team.",

    "fullText": "COUNTRIES LIKE COMPANIES\n\nRegarding trade imbalances with a fixed currency:\n\n1) I don\u2019t believe in the oft-repeated Keynesian idea that \u201cgovernments aren\u2019t households/companies so they don\u2019t need to balance their budget.\u201d\n\n2) For one thing, the largest companies are now bigger and wealthier than all but the largest governments, and if we agree that a company like Apple needs to balance its books then so does at least 50% of the UN.\n\n3) For another thing, only the very largest and most powerful states can print/counterfeit money and kill people without reprisal, which is the primary way they differ from households, and this relative power imbalance is falling every day. On many dimensions the CEO of Meta is more powerful than many heads of state.\n\n4) So, if companies need to manage their \u201ctrade imbalances\u201d over the long run by producing more than they consume, so will countries. A company that spends more than it earns and runs out of cash gets external investors or is shut down/acquired. \n\n5) Similarly a country that runs out of money by importing much more than it exports (\u201ctrade imbalance\u201d) will need external help of some kind or get \u201cacquired\u201d by a bigger country. This already exists today when there is a balance-of-payments crisis, whether the party stepping in is IMF or Belt and Road.\n\nThere will probably be more options in the world to come (perhaps selling territory again as per Alaska and Louisiana Purchase), but the point is there is no free lunch \u2014 you can\u2019t import more valuable goods than you export indefinitely without paying for it somehow.",

  "2024-03-17|HYPERDEFLATION > SAVINGS > EQUITY > DEBT  In a Bit": {
    "id": "1769502430381899985",
    "fullText": "HYPERDEFLATION > SAVINGS > EQUITY > DEBT\n\nIn a Bitcoin-backed economy, the hypothetical debt-deflation issues would be avoided by (a) minimizing debt and (b) funding more things with savings and equity as well as (c) leaning into technological hyperdeflation of costs.\n\nTo take those points in turn:\n\n1) We have way too much debt in society. At the individual level it\u2019s student loans, 30 year mortgages, credit cards, and even AfterPay. At the state level it\u2019s dysfunctional municipal debt, constant bond issuance, and soaring interest payments.\n\nThis world is ending. As Dalio has also discussed, the sovereign debt crises are beginning and the debt deleveraging is coming. Many debts will face hard default because they won\u2019t be paid. Others will experience soft default where a sovereign prints away the debt, satisfying it in nominal but not real terms.\n\nBut overall, many who owe money won\u2019t pay, and many who think they are owed money won\u2019t be getting paid. It may be a debt jubilee of a very messy kind, and it\u2019ll mean long-term skepticism towards debt.\n\n2) If you zoom out, many faith traditions from Christianity to Islam to Judaism have had taboos against usury. Yet somehow interest rates have recently been put at the very center of what was once Western civilization, as everyone fixates on the Fed\u2019s rate gyrations.\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t completely remove the concept of interest rates \u2014 they are a power user tool to compare different kinds of investments \u2014 but you can radically reduce the emphasis on them by prioritizing technological hyperdeflation of cost over savings, savings over equity financing, and equity over debt \u2014 in that order.\n\n3) Why put technological hyperdeflation of cost as first priority? Well, in the absence of the Fed monkeying around with things, we should be able to see that the real prices for things decline as technology improves. Eg with better tech we use fewer joules of energy to produce a smartphone or a tomato. So, sharply reducing real costs with tech is the first priority.\n\n4) Why savings over equity as second priority? Well, most things shouldn\u2019t need to be financed with external parties. You just save up and buy them yourself. And don\u2019t buy till you need them. But the focus on technological hyperdeflation means real cost keeps coming down \u2014 so savings can be viably used to buy more things.\n\n5) Then why equity over debt as third resort? Equity is how tech does financing and it is good for ambitious things and people. It\u2019s far more tolerant of uncertainty than debt and is more suited to our time of ultra-high volatility. It\u2019s also suitable only for high potential people and projects, as opposed to our current practice of saddling everyone with debt.\n\n6) Finally, debt is an absolute last resort for financing. It will be frowned upon in the next generation after the upcoming debt deleveraging. Debt should just be an extremely uncommon thing, used only by power users in highly certain circumstances.\n\n7) And how do you save at scale then, if governments aren\u2019t issuing bonds? Ideally, you invest in Bitcoin. In practice, for technical reasons not everyone will be able to hold BTC directly, but there will be enough who do that it\u2019ll keep the global economy honest.\n\nBitcoin is the index asset of the entire technologically hyperdeflating economy. It\u2019s like a combination of gold and Vanguard. It\u2019s a simple \u201cno op\u201d which is valued in every country and which everything else is benchmarked against, as is already happening in the cryptoeconomy.\n\n8) Finally, what about money for innovation? Yes, only really good investments will be worth risking the natural appreciation of your Bitcoin \u2014 but a state limited by Bitcoin is also far less able to jack up costs by uselessly NIMBYing new technologies, so the overall ability to innovate will be increased.\n\nThe Wild West era where a gold standard coincided with immense American technological innovation is the most obvious historical parallel.",

    "fullText": "A few things:\n\n1) The fees show the Bitcoin network is valuable enough that users are provably paying to use it. In that sense they are analogous to cash flows.\n\n2) The BTC to the miners is a little bit like stock-based compensation for employees. If you give employees stock, they can sell it, and that's an expense that can reduce the price of your stock. But it's also an expense that many high-flying companies have.\n\n3) I agree with your implicit point, that proof-of-stake doesn't have the same semi-obligate downward price pressure. However, proof-of-stake also has weak subjectivity issues unlike proof-of-work. I'm not a maximalist and see room for both.\n\n4) At 50000 feet, if you had a social network that made ~$0 per year in 2010 and $1B/year in 2024, it'd be a fairly fast growing company. So too for a currency network. \n\n5) In general: analogies like this are like the analogy between paper documents and digital documents. They break down if you push on them too hard. But they are meant to rebut the idea that these networks are just pet rocks without any economic substance.\n\n6) I think there is way more substance here than just the direct fees (what's the value of seizure resistance, or a global historical record and notary public?).

    "id": "1769465827529805846",
    "fullText": "Agree with some of this:\n\n1) First, absolutely, many don't want to invest directly in China. After what's happened to even Chinese tech zillionaires, you can't blame them.\n\n2) Moreover, various sanctions have made it hard to do business there, though eg many major companies like Apple continue to do so \u2014 as they set up their supply chains during Obama-era Chimerica when it would have been considered racist to *not* do business there.\n\nBut on these parts:\n\n3) Are the US FDI numbers real, though? The Netherlands is coming in at 4.3T in 2021 in this graph and Luxembourg at 3.32T. Those tiny countries aren't actually getting \"foreign direct investment\" into their physical plants. The numbers are similar to the Treasury foreign holdings chart. I'd have to dig into the FDI definitions, but the IMF itself admits they can just be financial stats rather than true \"direct investment\":\n\nhttps://t.co/PeiygYblOd\n\n4) So in that case a big chunk of the US \"FDI\" is probably people still buying Treasuries on autopilot, as if the BLM riots of 2020 weren't enough signal that the country had fundamentally changed. And everyone who did that autopilot buying got rekt, once the Fed devalued the Treasuries.\n\n5) Finally, China is a low-cost producer and a lender in its own right, so a trillion goes a *much* longer way there than it does in the profligate US. As per above, you get a train for $7.3B in China, and nothing for $100B in Blue America. And China is itself investing in other countries via Belt and Road and the like.\n\nSo: I don't think these numbers show the clean US win / China loss that you're thinking. \n\nChina is still doing extremely well in the physical world, with cheap production, and has enough money to invest in other countries. \n\nThe US is still doing extremely poorly in the physical world, with expensive/nonexistent production, and is burning $10B/day while also \"investing\" countless billions in foreign wars.",

  "2024-03-17|VOTE FOR BITCOIN  The post below by @MacroScope17": {
    "id": "1769453767140008161",
    "fullText": "VOTE FOR BITCOIN\n\nThe post below by @MacroScope17 is excellent. Let me extend his point one step further: the real election is BTC vs USD, the primaries have already started across the world, and every ballot counts. So make sure to vote early and often. Here's why this is more than a metaphor.\n\n1) THEY CAN'T FAKE THE PRICE OF BITCOIN\nFirst, the USD/BTC exchange rate is the one financial indicator that DC can\u2019t fake. Remember the mortgage-backed securities that were supposedly rated AAA? And the devalued bonds that got magically revalued at 100 cents on the dollar by BTFP? All of those are stats within the Fed's video game, so they can be rewritten at will...but the Fed can't print more BTC. So they can't fake the Bitcoin price.\n\n2) THEY CAN'T BLOCK THE EXIT TO BITCOIN\nSince they can't fake the price of Bitcoin, the only thing the tradfi system could do is try to block the exit from dollars to Bitcoin. Which is why the SEC fought against ETF access for ten years. They finally lost on Aug 29, 2023. The three judges on the Grayscale case were Neomi Rao, Harry Edwards, and \u2014\u00a0yes \u2014 Sri Srinivasan (it's a common surname!). I'm not sure if even those august magistrates yet understand that their decision may end up being among the most important rulings in history.\n\n3) THEY CAN'T STOP THE LEDGER OF BITCOIN\nWait \u2014 why could this random case actually be among the most important decisions of all time? Because unlike dollars in bank accounts, or stocks on brokerage accounts, or even real estate in blue states...Bitcoin exists on a ledger that the federal government does not control. So if more value is allowed to flow to that ledger, that's value that Keynesians can't freeze, seize, inflate, or confiscate. Not trivially, at least. Not without going house-to-house and beating it out of you, like their cousins the Communists did. So this court decision is important because it opened the floodgates, allowing value to flow towards the Bitcoin ledger \u2014 and away from DC's control.\n\n4) THEY CAN'T STOP THE INCENTIVES OF BITCOIN\nAnd every day that Bitcoin is available to Wall Street is a day that millions more gets invested in Bitcoin. Bitcoin's incentives were strong enough to recruit not just BlackRock, but Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and a critical mass of major firms. It is literally the best-performing asset of all time, and one of the best of this year. So, not having it in your portfolio in Q1 2024 will make you a loser. It remains to be seen whether the Vanguard CEO was fired over his opposition to Bitcoin, but it is a distinct possibility. The incentive alignment is incredible: even the Fed can't pay everyone as much as Bitcoin can, because the more they print, the more BTC goes up.\n\n5) THEY CAN'T STOP THE SIGNAL OF BITCOIN\nSo, every single day the regime is now bleeding support to Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin is rising. Its vertical rise signals that something is wrong  in the legacy economy. It's a blazing fire alarm, an orange BitSignal glowing in the sky telling you that the smart money no longer has full faith and confidence in fiat.\n\nThat's why this is the true election. Everyone gets a vote, worldwide. Whether they're a US citizen doesn't matter, because billions are under the thumb of the dollar. They know their vote counts because they can count how many BTC they got in their vote. They know Satoshi actually keeps his campaign promises, unlike the GOP or DNC. And they know the BTC price signal is a vote count no regime can easily rig.\n\nIt's similar to the plebiscites at the end of the USSR. Back then, truly free speech and free elections finally allowed people to vote against the Communists. Now, truly free markets and free internet allow you to vote against the Keynesians.\n\n6) THEY CAN'T DO QE IN THE PRESENCE OF BTC\nThe reason the smart money is moving to Bitcoin is that it suspects the money is gone, that the US cannot pay its debts in real terms, that the shell game is soon to stop, and that it\u2019s time to get out before Powell\u2019s \u201csoft landing\u201d crashes the plane.\n\nAnd in the presence of Bitcoin, if the Fed runs the same playbook they did in 2008, it'll have the opposite effect. Back then, everyone was in USD-linked assets because there was no alternative. So the cost of QE was spread across unsuspecting billions worldwide, and everyone was diluted to pay for DEI mortgages.\n\nToday, Bitcoin holders see it coming. So any big print like 2008 will boomerang on fiat holders. The more fiat you hold, the more of your net worth will be diluted away to pay the unpayable debts of this failed state. Everyone will be expropriated to the extent they trust the US government.\n\n7) THEY MAY USE FORCE LOCALLY AGAINST BTC\nRemember how the media flipped from attacking social media as unimportant to attacking social media because it was too important? That may come for Bitcoin.\n\nBecause we already know that a president without Twitter isn't really president. Soon a government without Bitcoin won't really be a government. It'll be like an old government without gold; it won't be able to pay for things. And the thing is, lack of money is even more important than lack of media. So expect the delayed reaction to Bitcoin's rise to be...frantic.\n\nI wouldn't want to live in a blue state then, because the Keynesians will whip up hatred against Bitcoiners as their Communist predecessors did against kulaks. They'll call hodlers hoarders, they'll denounce them publicly, and things will get extremely nasty.\n\nJust visualize the same BLM/antifa/Hamas mobs that have been burning buildings and blocking roads for the better part of a decade, except this time with the support of blue-controlled police and military. If that sounds unrealistic, remember that's what literally hundreds of millions of people endured in the 20th century under communism. This time, however, the farthest left regime in the world is in DC \u2014 not overseas \u2014 and when it runs out of money, it will run after yours.\n\nSo if you stay in a blue state, I hope you can shoot like Rittenhouse. Many millions of people have already moved from blue states to red states (or abroad) because of crimes, syringes, and feces \u2014 and it might be good to join them sooner rather than later.\n\n8) THEY CAN'T USE FORCE GLOBALLY AGAINST BTC\nHere's the good news. While Canada and much of Western Europe may end up following DC's lead, there will probably be enough purple states, red states, and foreign states \u2014 enough places run by genuine liberals, centrists, conservatives, and libertarians \u2014 that DC won't be able to seize all the BTC.  This regime is losing to the *Houthis*, so it likely can't take everybody at once.\n\n9) YES, THERE ARE MANY COUNTERARGUMENTS\nI already hear you. There are many counterarguments to the scenario I just raised.\n\n- Isn't all the ETF Bitcoin custodial?\n- Aren't all Bitcoin holders known to the state?\n- Doesn't Bitcoin have limited onchain scalability?\n- Isn't Bitcoin limited in terms of its privacy?\n- Can't Big Tech surveil everyone?\n- What about China, and AI, and so on?\n\nAnd so on and so forth. There are probably 20 more FAQs of this nature, and it's worth a follow-up post. But the short answer is: sure, there are many possible scenarios where the regime still wins, but as you think through the chess match it is also now possible that they lose.\n\nFor example: will the regime have the cooperation of Wall Street in an attempted seizure? How many onchain transactions do you actually need to convey a global price signal? And won't there be many states like El Salvador and likely Texas/Florida/Hungary/etc that flip to Bitcoin? The fundamental question is whether the bad people behind the Fed can outsmart the good people in Bitcoin. And thus far, the Network has outpaced the State.\n\n10) THIS IS THE REAL ELECTION\nSo: that's why BTC vs USD is the real election. It's more important than GOP vs DNC. It's an election where one candidate is *un*controlled opposition. It's an election where the whole world legitimately has the franchise, because the whole world is diluted by the dollar. It's an election where the world can deprecate the 20th century centralized state, and reverse a century of Keynesianism and Communism.\n\nPolling has begun.\nGo vote early and often.",

    "fullText": "CHINA HAS ROOT\n\nWhy can\u2019t we just count on China falling into a ditch like Japan did?\n\nWell, China has root over its internal system. That\u2019s arguably its #1 national priority since the Sino-Soviet split: fork and regain root control.\n\nThey have root control over communist ideology (\u201cCommunism with Chinese characteristics\u201d), over internet traffic (The Great Firewall), and over their national currency (digital yuan). \n\nUnlike modern Japan, Zhongnanhai wants to be in total control at all times \u2014 and can/will take significant long-term hits to status & money to maximize power. \n\nAs a concrete example of the difference between Japan and China, see the NYT admission-against-interest below and related threads by @levelsio and @Kdenkss on the Plaza Accords.\n\nJapan could never kill US spies and would never do so. China can and does, knowing how much silent backlash that will generate. As a consequence, China can maintain secure internal communications that DC can\u2019t see. So Beijing can do things like the Mate 60 Pro surprise dropped on Gina Raimondo, where they demonstrated US sanctions couldn\u2019t hold back Chinese chips.\n\nThink about how hard DC has recently been trying to stop China, with sanctions and trade war and attempts at diplomatic isolation and so on, and you\u2019ll probably agree that\u2019s a series of escalating steps to retain dominance that could have been applied to Japan as well.\n\nBut Reagan\u2019s America was a lot more competent than Biden\u2019s America, and Japan was 10X smaller than China and less sovereign. So Robert Lighthizer and the 1980s trade war of the Plaza Accords were enough to do the trick. Japan Inc was nonviolently forced to revalue its currency, cripple its export economy, and buy US bonds rather than US companies. Everyone thought it happened organically, but it was a set of artificial limiters put on Japan\u2019s economy.\n\nChina has studied all that. They are 10X bigger than Japan, and much meaner. Because they desire root control, they are not going to go under in the same way Japan did.\n\nBasically: Japan is Hello Kitty, while China will kill to retain sovereignty. They are just a completely different animal.\nhttps://t.co/Wobdy2xm2w",

    "fullText": "Here\u2019s the logic.\n\n1) Trillions of dollars were printed in 2020. This created absolutely no new goods and services, but simply used the chaos of COVID to dilute down your USD balances for the state to redistribute.\n\n2) Due to the Cantillon effect, the state and state-affiliated actors received the benefit of that printed money first. Just like a counterfeiter benefits first from a new bill.\n\n3) The 23.98% reduction in purchasing power is like a wealth tax. It applies to literally every dollar you own, not just incoming money.\n\n4) Bitcoin holders unaffected. Trusting the US establishment in any way is the only way to lose. If you trust the media to report the truth, the police to protect you from crime, or the banks to safeguard your funds, you\u2019ll have a bad time.\n\n5) In particular, journalists and bureaucrats will fake the stats all the way to the bitter end, just like they did in the 2008 financial crisis with AAA mortgages. After that point, who coulda knew? It is on you to distrust them en masse and exit this system now to the maximum of your ability.\n\n6) Even the 23.98% aggregate number is probably an underestimate and would be worth recalculating with the old methodology that also includes the (enormous!) impact of rate hikes on personal interest payments. Larry Summers below estimates that to be 18% in one year alone \u2014 which would mean the compounded wealth seizure since Jan 2020 will probably be around 50%.\n\n7) Credit to Professor Summers for his important post, clarifying exactly how they\u2019re cooking the books this time. He\u2019s one of the best of the establishment guys and that\u2019s why the proto-wokes canceled him in 2005. He will always be my (Harvard) President. \ud83d\ude01",

  "2024-01-11|HISTORY IS RUNNING IN REVERSE  The Bitcoin ETF is": {
    "id": "1745290212425756780",
    "fullText": "HISTORY IS RUNNING IN REVERSE\n\nThe Bitcoin ETF is the spiritual reversal of Executive Order 6102. Back in 1935, they seized the gold. But now, digital gold is back.\n\nNinety years ago, FDR and his fellow travelers rode the 20th century arc of centralization. The chokepoints of then-new technologies for mass media and mass production allowed them to gain control over the population, recruit top talent for their \"Brain Trust\", and seize the gold after a series of epic legal battles[1].\n\nThose gold clause cases are forgotten today, but received as much contemporary coverage as 9/11 or the Moon Landing. They were the most important issue in the country, receiving far more coverage than seemingly comparable Supreme Court decisions like Roe vs Wade. Why?[2]\n\nThe reason is that the transition from a gold-backed to fiat-backed system was comparable to a soft communist revolution, as the *visible* seizure of gold laid the groundwork for the *invisible* seizure of wealth via money printing.\n\nAnd the classically trained judges at that time fully understood this. Justice McReynolds' then-famous dissent denounced the ruling in the harshest terms, noting that the \"Constitution is gone\" and the \"dollar...may be 30c tomorrow, 10c the next day, and 1c the day following\".[3]\n\nMcReynolds was right.\n\nWhile the court was forced into a grudging institutional surrender by FDR's threat of court-packing[2], the gold clause case affected every economic decision-maker in the country, as it amounted to the US government explicitly defaulting on its bonds by seizing the assets of its citizens, laying the groundwork for the century of monetary debasement to come.[4]\n\nNow all of that is unwinding. FDR's team could ride the wave of centralizing technology that built giant states around the world. But today, technology today favors *decentralization* \u2014\u00a0personal computers, end-to-end encryption, mobile phones, and of course cryptocurrency [5]. \n\nThus, top talent isn't being pulled into a government Brain Trust. It's being brain drained *out* of the US establishment. And as a consequence the epic legal battles are, on balance, going our way.\n\nIt's not just the DC Circuit case.[6] The ideological conflict between decentralization and centralization is reflected in the 3-2 vote for the Bitcoin ETF approval itself. Read Peirce's brilliant pro-liberty approval[7],  Crenshaw's dour denial[8], and Gensler's reluctant approval[9].\n\nYou'll see echos of the gold clause case, but in reverse. This time, it is the centralized state that is being forced into a grudging institutional surrender. And a surrender it is, as Crenshaw's dissent[8] makes clear: \n\n\"...there is no primary regulator for the bitcoin spot markets. Spot bitcoin ETPs will be participating in an unregulated, fragmented, continuously traded, global free-for-all. Even if there were a primary regulator for this market, much of it could be beyond the reach of U.S. regulation...\"\n\nLet that sink in! This is what the US establishment truly fears: not Bitcoin as \"fraud\", but Bitcoin as freedom. They want to rule not just you but the world, so they're scared of the prospect of \"a global free-for-all..beyond the reach of US regulation\". And they know that any spot ETF will bid up the price of self-custodied Bitcoin outside their control[10], as Satoshi intended.\n\nSo: since FDR's seizure of gold, our lives have revolved around the centralized state rather than the decentralized market. The state has had control for so long we've forgotten what freedom is like. But now gold is slipping out of their hands, and back into yours.\n\nHistory is running in reverse.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/yl0MCTRrlg\n[2]: https://t.co/92ahAV1AeY\n[3]: https://t.co/MknSZv5Q6g\n[4]: https://t.co/dbYcaOXyff\n[5]: https://t.co/1DWoz5f6nW\n[6]: https://t.co/COJmRAwO3K\n[7]: https://t.co/pipMkosz5k\n[8]: https://t.co/4tSlPrST9c\n[9]: https://t.co/ZWjdGrRMXJ\n[10]: https://t.co/XMCEWu2PK9",

    "fullText": "ANALYSIS OF COMPETING HYPOTHESES\n\nI appreciate this post by @robbensinger because it reminds me of a CIA technique called the \"Analysis of Competing Hypotheses.\"\n\nThe concept is documented at length in Chapter 8 of Heuer's 1999 book on the Psychology of Intelligence Analysis[1]. But the idea is relatively simple: when smart people differ, it's often due to a difference in premises that you can tease out.\n\nThe figure below is an example[2] for a corporation arguing about the root cause of why competitors keep beating their bids very narrowly and on price.\n\n1) You first put the hypotheses across the top \u2014 are hackers stealing commercial information in general, are specific insiders selling commercial information, or have listening devices been placed in the office[3]?\n\n2) Then you put the observed facts down the side \u2014\u00a0you're seeing that quotes are consistently and narrowly beaten on price, that the leaks are from all departments, and so on.\n\n3) Finally, you score each observation as consistent or inconsistent with the hypothesis. For example, if you observed that the \"leaked information is from all departments\" that would be inconsistent with a \"specific insider is selling commercial information\", because the insider wouldn't know about all departments.\n\n4) While the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses is overkill for routine debugging, I find it helpful for getting at the root cause in complex situations where there are many hypotheses and observations floating around.\n\n5) Seems like it might be useful to do this for AI, where intelligent people disagree on unarticulated premises. Perhaps the single biggest areas I disagree with the AI safety people on is the utility of appealing to a dysfunctional US government to regulate AI. This government causes existential risks (like funding the Wuhan lab and risking nuclear war with Russia), it doesn't mitigate them.\n\n6) As such, I think technology work > policy work for just about anything, but particularly cutting edge areas where the state is either ignorant or hostile or both.\n \n[1]: https://t.co/qV3cx7Xn4W\n[2]: https://t.co/cYFvS415FG\n[3]: The latter seems paranoid but would be a legitimate concern for semiconductor companies competing with China.",

    "id": "1734629185451340173",
    "fullText": "THE NEW HOLY TRINITY\n\nA few miscellaneous observations on the foundations of what was once Western civilization.\n\n1) The new holy trinity is both newer and older than you might think. Newer in the sense of being brand new moral premises on which to found (or deconstruct) a society. But older in the sense of going back many more decades than the 2010s.\n\n2) The new holy trinity is also a set of moral premises that displaces earlier moral premises. Because the human mind can only recall so many commandments. Even 10 is kind of pushing it. \n\nSo, for example, a society that says \u201cthou shalt not lie\u201d is different from a society that says \u201cthou shalt not be racist.\u201d What if stating the truth would be baselessly attacked as racist? Then you might not state the truth. \n\nAnd thus do the new moral premises displace the old. You get a society of liars, but at least they\u2019re not \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nA great example of this is the controversy over the drug BiDil.[1] Sure, the data showed it helped African Americans with heart failure. But wait \u2014 prescribing it would mean saying self-identified ancestry has some correlation with biology! And so the usual suspects got to protesting medical racism, harming the population they pretended to help. They may have lied about the data, but at least they weren\u2019t \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n3) Next \u2014 the new holy trinity has marched upwards for almost 100 years. See how these curves move up over decades, but with cyclic pauses every so often?[2]\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s just an artifact of the data analysis. Or perhaps that\u2019s when conservatives think they\u2019re \u201cwinning\u201d, in those moments when there is a slight downturn in the chart. The pendulum is swinging, baby! The silent majority is asserting itself. And we are so back.\n\nActually \u2014 no. In retrospect, during those periods, wokism was just consolidating power for the next upward push. Like Lenin\u2019s New Economic Policy, which was a head fake that lulled people to complacency before the next bout of communist insanity[3].\n\n4) So: what could stop the multi-decadal rise of the new holy trinity? Well, a true change (rather than a head fake) would show woke terms drop off a cliff in usage, just as their Marxist equivalents did in the territories of the former Soviet Union after 1991.\n\nAfter all, you didn\u2019t hear too much about \u201cclass struggle\u201d, \u201cworkers of the world\u201d, or \u201ccomrades\u201d after that ideology produced a calamitous imperial collapse.[4]\n\nBut that\u2019s what it took to kill Soviet communism. Not a fake internal reform like the New Economic Policy, but an actual collapse.\n\nSomething to keep in mind\u2026\n[1]: https://t.co/FhSFEgBXUJ\n[2]: https://t.co/hKEZL4JO5o\n[3]: https://t.co/6lkEaOQOZT\n[4]: https://t.co/oGJlbOPl96",

    "fullText": "AI, e/acc, and decentralization\n\n> e/acc bros are generally optimistic about tech... the one exception is a lot of us are nocoiners and fairly negative on crypto.  why is this?\n\nGood topic. First, it's a bit more than just two camps. I think it's more like five, arranged in order of most to least statist.\n\n1) AI risk: wants state to stop AGI\n2) e/acc-c: is fine with centralized AI\n3) e/acc-d: wants decentralized AI\n4) Crypto: wants decentralized alternatives to web2\n5) Bitcoin: wants total focus on decentralized alternative to Fed\n\nThe most important difference between these camps is *not* on the tech, but on the ideological values underneath. The key question is: how much do you trust Washington, DC?\n\n1) AI riskers de facto trust it a lot, because they want to empower it to do \"airstrikes on datacenters\" (even after DC just aimlessly blew up the Middle East for 20 years). \n\n2) e/acc-c may not go that far, but they're willing to tolerate significant amounts of state failure to live in places like San Francisco.\n\n3) e/acc-d is where some decentralization starts kicking in. They don't trust the SF city government, so they want to make radical moves to fix the city. They also don't fully trust centralized corporations, so they want to decentralize the models, as Llama 2 has done.\n\n4) crypto is even more focused on decentralization, but in what they would call a pragmatic way. They'd argue that decentralization is a continuum, and that services that are more open than existing web2 backends are important to the way forward.\n\n5) Bitcoin maximalism is not only focused on decentralization, they think everything besides Bitcoin is a distraction because it takes away attention from the most pressing issue of it all: the ultimate rugpull by the US government, the Fed's ongoing devaluation of the dollar.\n\nThe conflict that @mimi10v3 sees is between groups 1/2 and groups 3/4/5, but groups 2/3 are really quite distinct in their thinking. \n\n(You could in theory believe in both AGI apocalypse and Bitcoin apocalypse, but the nature of such things is that camps 1 and 5 have relatively little overlap, because camp 1 ends up advocating for powering up DC and while camp 5 ends up taking it away.)\n\nMy view is that the oncoming rush of AI regulations and ongoing real-cost-of-living increases will move more people into groups 3-5, the decentralization-focused groups. \n\nAnd it really all boils down to how much you trust DC.",

    "id": "1703829675058037144",
    "fullText": "Yes, I get that this is the theory. But a few thoughts.\n\n1) First, the right way to proceed is to reduce the cost of living through technological innovation and sunsetting obsolete regulations. Financial manipulations can only get us so far. Interest rate changes won't structurally reduce the cost of (say) space flight.\n\n2) Second, many people don't have ultra-flexible short-term debt where they can instantly respond to changes in rates. Many took on long-term debt before Dec 2021 given Powell and Yellen's repeated promises that rates would be kept low forever.\n\n3) Third, individuals feel the rising costs imposed by both inflation and rate hikes at the same time. Their actual concern is rising cost-of-living.\n\n4) Fourth, part of the goal of the rate hikes is as Powell said: to put people out of work. And if your income is $0 then everything is now very costly.\n\n5) Finally, inflation reduces the cost of borrowing money because it eats into the real value of the amount owed and is typically good for the borrower. We are in a bad state right now, though where rates keep getting hiked to try to get them above official inflation. \n\nSo many borrowers are dreading the date when they need to refinance, and many lenders are treading water till they can finally refinance.\n\nhttps://t.co/XEHI0HX2bn",

    "fullText": "SATOSHI AND SATYA\n\nI agree with some of Samo\u2019s other points in the thread \u2014 but exit amplifies voice.\n\n1) It\u2019s only because Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore existed that Deng Xiaoping had a model to turn around China. \n\nAll the Chinese people who wanted to leave the PRC told everyone that something was wrong. The military strength of tiny capitalist Taiwan was even becoming comparable to the PRC in 1978. Without the evidence that Chinese people could live better lives, a \u201ccapitalist roader\u201d like Deng would never have taken power.\n\n2) Similarly, it\u2019s only because of Apple and Google that Satya Nadella had a model to turn around Microsoft. All the Microsoft customers who left for those companies told him something was wrong, and proved the case for a \u201ccloud roader\u201d to take power \u2014 leaning into cloud, mobile, and now even stealing a march on Google with AI.\n\n3) But turnaround of this kind is extremely difficult and often doesn\u2019t work. So for the individual with no realistic chance of taking power and executing a turnaround (or doing so as a group), like the millions of Chinese who weren\u2019t Deng or the millions of customers that didn\u2019t want to wait a decade for Ballmer to be replaced, the true vote against a failing regime is exit.\n\n4) Sometimes the place these people are leaving fixes itself, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but at least rather than just complaining they show that the problems were real enough to actually pick up stakes and leave. The exiters shock people out of complacency with an unfakable high cost signal \u2014 because it\u2019s a huge pain to leave. The ultimate civic duty, patriotism *as* dissent.\n\n5) In general, we need both Satoshis and Satyas. People who execute the exit *and* people who tough it out for the turnaround.\n\n6) But these are complementary strategies: because both Satoshi and Satya understand there is something deeply broken with the prevailing order. Neither are Ballmers.",

There\u2019s an established business model, name recognition, a baseline level of social legitimacy.\n\nHowever, these days that institutional safety really isn\u2019t all its cracked up to be. \n\nPeople who joined big companies at high salaries in the 2010s and didn\u2019t take conscious risks gradually got acclimatized to high spending and low work output.\n\nIf they get suddenly laid off in their late 30s or 40s, it can be difficult to get a new job at the same or higher compensation level.\n\nOne option is to constantly take risks and reinvent yourself every ~5 years. You keep opting out and leveling up. That\u2019s doable for a certain kind of personality, but it is quite hard to do. \n\nThe alternative is to watch every dime like the leanFIRE people, and refrain from unnecessary consumption, in the assumption that today\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d salary may not be sustainable. You might couple this with moving to an extremely low cost locale.\n\nBut that also means opting out in a different way. You\u2019d have a typical job perhaps, but an atypical spending pattern.\n\nAnyway, Disney has a market cap of $160B. It\u2019s been around for generations. It owns iconic brands. And it\u2019s probably still a decent job. \n\nBut I have a feeling that the extreme corporate risk aversion manifested here \u2014 to the point that they either voluntarily divested a half billion dollar asset, or were forced to by hostile regulators \u2014 isn\u2019t going to serve them well in a time when all the cartoons can be generated by artificial intelligence  and all the engagement is going to iconoclastic individuals.\n\nLike Portnoy.",

    "fullText": "Some follow up thoughts.\n\n1) In addition to using AI to inexpensively *read* corporate PDFs, of course you also want to use it to cheaply *write* corporate PDFs.\n\nBecause if we go back to the analogy of a folder of corporate contracts as a database, right now every interaction with that database has a *cost*. It\u2019s not just reading contracts that has expense. To write a contract also means paying fees[a] to lawyers and governments.\n\nSo we want to start thinking of these as paired read/write operations, where we use the same AI tools to write contracts as we do to query them. You\u2019d thus get a consistent set of prompts, templates, and file naming conventions across your business.\n\nIt\u2019s create-read-update-delete (CRUD), but for the PDF contracts that currently constitute corporations.\n\n2) The other extension is to do AI summarization not just for PDFs but for emails and wikis. Again, this all may be obvious, but I\u2019ll write it up anyway in the off chance it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAs you know, we\u2019ve now seen the advent of AI synthesis of new content in tools like Superhuman (@rahulvohra) and Notion (@akothari). And this is already useful, and I pay for it.\n\nHowever, AI querying and summarization of natural language emails and wikis is, in my view, much more valuable.\n\nFor example, can you query an entire mailbox with 100k+ emails to output a clean table with all relevant emails and attachments for a given deal?\n\nCan you summarize hundreds of pages of daily notes from a tool like Notion or Roam (@Conaw) and tell the user something they didn\u2019t know, like things they noted as important two years ago but had forgotten about?\n\nIf so, that would really start turning emails and wikis into second brains. A human can\u2019t read 1000s of pages per day, but an AI now can.\n\n[a]: The onchain analog to legal fees is transaction fees. To update a smart contract is to pay fees to engineers and blockchains.",

    "id": "1688893237547958272",
    "fullText": "COPILOT FOR CORPORATIONS\n\nHow do you double the value of cloud storage? Add AI summarization of PDFs, thereby allowing businesses to replace millions in legal bills with thousands in SaaS fees. It\u2019d be like Github Copilot, but for corporations.\n\nAs context, every founder and investor has at least one huge directory of PDFs. Your corporate bylaws, your employment agreements, your investment docs \u2014 this folder is essentially a database of contracts.\n\nBut right now, this crucial database can only be read one file at a time, and often only by a legal expert. Yeah, you can do keyword search, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as comprehending a 200 page PDF summarizing an acquisition.\n\nSo what people do today is: pay expensive lawyers to ask questions about the docs. This is the most expensive search engine in the world, often costing hundreds of dollars per query, and taking hours if not days between each query.\n\nBut now there\u2019s an alternative. OpenAI has added several AI PDF readers as plugins to GPT4. And while they\u2019re early and finicky and often can\u2019t read many PDFs due to OCR and other issues, they are amazing when they work.\n\nThe next step is to just bring that tech in situ. We need to make it run in the background of every cloud storage app, so you don\u2019t need to manually upload countless PDFs to a new service.\n\nThat means configurable AI summarization of every PDF, every folder of PDFs, every folder of folders. \n\nYou might set up some prompts to run on every PDF (\u201cwhat\u2019s this document about in one sentence\u201d), and others from collections of related PDFs (\u201cread all these employment agreements and generate a table of salaries\u201d). You could even have AI suggest automatic, consistent titles for all files.\n\nThese prompts would execute asynchronously upon file upload, like video encoding. So you wouldn\u2019t put a ton of load on the server, and it would process your files when it had a chance. \n\nMoreover, you\u2019d have to set up the privacy settings just right, but once you did\u2026the AI that read *all* of your PDFs would be like your corporate lawyer. They\u2019d know everything about your entity and its history and be available day or night to answer questions \u2014 in seconds for a few cents, rather than days for many dollars.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t put good lawyers out of work. It just allows them to focus on higher order questions. And they could still be cc\u2019d (at much lower cost) to provide attorney/client privilege on every AI question you ask.\n\nStill, as PDF sharing is perhaps the number one enterprise use case for cloud storage, reducing legal expenses could be a huge growth opportunity for Zoho (@svembu), Box (@levie), and Dropbox (@drewhouston).\n\nIf they shift just a few billable hours of legal work per year per person into SaaS fees for cloud, that could easily be +$1000/year.\n\nThese companies even have their own internal corporate document collections to use as training data, to dogfood the product and generate the top 5 most useful prompts for different kinds of document collections.\n\nAnyway, all of this is probably obvious to them and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are already working on it. But if not \u2014 first thing we do, let\u2019s automate all the lawyers.",

    "fullText": "CANCELING CANCEL CULTURE?\n\nHere's how @elonmusk could make this idea work in a cost-effective way.\n\n1) Curation. First, the word \"unfairly\" gives him discretion to curate which cases they'll take on. Twitter sets up a form where people can apply for legal relief by submitting relevant documentation and tweets, as an extension of the current support backend.\n\n2) Contingency. Second, Elon lines up a stable of First Amendment lawyers like @pnjaban and @marcorandazza to take the curated cases on contingency.\n\n3) Crowdfunding. Third, Elon sets up litigation finance vehicles where the public can crowdfund each case and get a share of the proceeds if they win. This is similar to how Thiel financed Hulk Hogan to beat Gawker, a media corporation that published naked images of Hogan without his consent for profit[1]. Except this time it's the public buying, say, 51% of each case as a sort of capitalistic vote for justice.\n\n4) Coverage. Finally, Elon turns Moments[2] back on, but with reverse polarity. This time, rather than some innocent person getting blasted online, the evil corporations and government agencies that censor speech will be the ones getting the attention of the public.\n\nSo: through curation, contingency, crowdfunding, and coverage he might just be able to start canceling cancel culture.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/6EMDWT59C3\n[2]: https://t.co/txYGdvfEVQ",

Then the US applied it on a global scale.\n\nThe Soviets were also pretty good at this. They had plenty of spies through the US as Venona revealed. And even got the US to fight Japan for them, as McMeekin wrote about.[2]\n\nIn many ways the Cold War was a contest of who could out-manipulate whom. Hot Wars, by contrast, are more about who can out-manufacture whom. The greatest countries are great at both.\n\nThe 20th century US, like the UK before it, was unusual in that it combined the financial cleverness of a tiny Switzerland with the industrial might of a giant like Germany. So it was good at both media/money/manipulation and manufacturing.\n\nIt had Wall Street *and* West Point, Hollywood *and* Detroit. The virtual and the physical. All the flash and all of the substance. For decades, at least.\n\nThe Soviets also had quite a bit of subversive guile and industrial might \u2014 but ultimately less than the US.

    "fullText": "CENTRAL BANKS ARE BUYING GOLD\n\nInvesco just released its annual global survey of 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing $21T.\n\nAnd what does it say?\n\n1) Flight to gold. \"Amid volatile [bond] yields, 2022 saw a flight to gold, questions around the US dollar\u2019s future as the world\u2019s reserve currency, and increased diversification of currency holdings.\"\n\n2) Gold hedges inflation. \"Reserve portfolio managers identified inflation as a key risk...69% of central banks countering global inflation through gold allocations.\"\n\n3) Gold as a safe-haven. \"96% of central banks increasing gold allocations cited its status as a \u2018safe-haven\u2019 asset\"\n\n4) Sanctions are a major factor. \"A substantial percentage of central banks are concerned about the precedent set by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) agreeing that the event has made gold more attractive.\"\n\n5) Physical gold in vaults only. \"Consequently, central banks now prefer to hold physical gold rather than gold ETFs or derivatives...\"\n\n6) Not even London is trusted. \"We...had it held in London...but we\u2019ve now transferred our gold reserves back to our own country to keep it safe \u2013 its role now is to be a safe-haven asset\u201d said one central bank based in the West.\n\n7) Yuan rising as a trade currency, not a 'reserve' currency. \"A considerable proportion do expect a shift towards renminbi (27% of central banks), but expectations differ based on the region.\"\n\n8) India now the #1 emerging market to invest in, over China. \"India has now overtaken China as the most attractive Emerging Market for investing in Emerging Market debt.\"\n\n9) Dollar is being hedged with EM currencies (!). \"While the US dollar is expected to retain its dominance, central banks are increasingly exploring diversification into Emerging Market currencies to hedge against volatility.\"\n\n10) Everyone wants to de-dollarize. \"People have been looking for alternatives to the dollar and euro for a long time and they would\u2019ve gone to them already if there were any suitable alternatives.\"\n\n--\n\nIn summary, they're buying gold, holding it in vaults, and preparing for high levels of inflation. They're reallocating capital away from volatile bonds, investing in India, and expecting the yuan to be used for trade rather than stored in reserves.\n\nAnd they're all seeking alternatives to the dollar, but haven't found it yet. However...I think their actions show that the alternative to the dollar is already here, even if not recognized as such.\n\nDe-dollarization is decentralization.\n\nThe reserve role is being taken up by hard assets like gold (and Bitcoin, as even Blackrock now admits). The trade role is taken up by currencies like the yuan (and rupee, and others). And other roles like payments, smart contracts, and the like are being taken up by different states or networks.\n\nSo the dollar is getting unbundled. When there's an alternative in every situation, much of the dollar's coercive power goes away. And that's the theme of this report \u2014 sovereigns are seeking an exit from the dollar, and a hedge against its uncertain future.\n\nhttps://t.co/hnJYxogxQ3",

    "id": "1678132524932026368",
    "fullText": "Some notes.\n\n1) An argument like this is refreshing relative to the mumbo-jumbo we hear from today\u2019s Fed.\n\nChase is *agreeing* that the money is all an illusion, and all that matters is whether governments can whip (or incentivize?) their citizens into a productive lather. This was more possible at the time due to technology favoring total centralization of power, and less possible today.\n\n2) Chase\u2019s viewpoint is *adjacent* to the broken windows fallacy, but that\u2019s not the entirety of it.\n\nIn Bastiat\u2019s classical broken windows setup, someone smashes a shopkeeper\u2019s window. And we see the money the shopkeeper allocates to the glazier for repairs but not what he would have spent it on \u2014 and we thus mistake the spending for economic activity *caused* by destruction.\n\nBut Chase\u2019s initial conditions are different. He\u2019s saying a country is essentially out of money, but then suddenly discovers productive capacity in the context of a war. For it to match the broken window setup, the shopkeeper wouldn\u2019t have a shop. So then, where\u2019s the money coming from?\n\n3) In each case you can argue with his examples. For example, Russia under the New Economic Policy in the late 20s wasn\u2019t as bad as Lenin\u2019s war communism, so they would have had more wealth to work with. \n\nAnd the American economy was hamstrung by the New Deal and (relatively) set free by war production, where many regulatory barriers were relaxed. For example, antitrust and labor laws (like Walsh-Healey) were suspended or ignored.\n\n4) But there is something to what is being said here. There is a capacity for rebirth in a country (like the German Economic Miracle after the war) that isn\u2019t typically there in a shorter-lived company. There\u2019s also truth in the idea that the right management and motivation can get much more productivity out of a population.\n\n5) However, I think it\u2019s wrong to say that incentives (and therefore money) don\u2019t matter because of the experience of wartime economies.\n\nTo the contrary, perhaps the most important reason war changes the economy has to do with the introduction of a huge new incentive for everyone: basically, work fast or die.",

    "fullText": "Yesterday\u2019s Keynesians were more interesting than today\u2019s Keynesians. They founded the system, after all.\n\n\u2014\nWHERE\u2019S THE MONEY COMING FROM?\nBy Stuart Chase, 1943\n\nIN 1925, Russia had been through a devastating war and a violent internal revolution. Her currency had been destroyed in a runaway price inflation, she was the world\u2019s worst financial risk abroad and she had very little gold. Yet by the end of the first Five Year Plan in 1933, Russia had invested some 60 billion rubles in factories, new cities, cities, hydroelectric developments, armaments, houses, schools. There stood the new plant, ugly and solid. Without it Russia could never have met the onslaught of Hitler\u2019s armies.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nIn 1933 it was freely prophesied that Italy could not invade Ethiopia. She had no credit abroad and almost no gold. The effort would bankrupt her. Italy went ahead, conquered Ethiopia, and emerged without financial collapse.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nHitler took over a Germany which was technically bankrupt. It had defaulted on its foreign obligations. When he proposed to build a powerful army, together with all kinds of grandiose public works, he was laughed at in London and New York. Germany was insolvent, and the whole idea was preposterous. The nations of Europe which have trembled under the thunder of panzer divisions know that Hitler built even more terribly than he promised.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nWhen Japan began to rattle her sword in the direction of Indo-China and challenge the United States and the British Empire, wiseacres said it was a bluff. The long years of the war in China had reduced the Japanese economy to a bag of bones. She was bankrupt and could not sustain a real fight. Yet she opened a new attack with devastating fury, and with military equipment in planes, tanks, artillery, ships, that was as excellent as it was unexpected.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nIn 1939, the United States Congress declined to appropriate $4 billions for highways, conservation, hospitals, freight cars, in the bitterly contested \u201clend-spend\u201d bill. It was widely held that the bill would lead to ruin and national bankruptcy. Yet since the fall of France in 1940, Congress has appropriated almost $300 billions for armaments\u2013seventy-five times as much as the lend-spend bill\u2013and a large fraction of it has already gone into tanks and guns. Far from being ruined, our national vitality has never been more vigorous, and great financial moguls assure us that we shall be able to swing the national debt.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nAfter the war America will need to maintain full employment, operate its industries at substantial capacity, provide the essentials of life for all its own citizens, and help foreign peoples who are starving and unable to pay for the supplies. There will be a towering political demand for a world delivered from chronic depression.\n\nWhere will the money come from?\n\n\u2026it is clear from these examples that what a great nation can \u201cafford\u201d in periods of crisis depends not on its money but on its man power and its goods. Russia, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United States, all used money in the situations mentioned, but money was obviously not the dominant factor. Man power and materials were the dominant factor.\n\nYet at other times, when crisis was not so acute, the money for necessary tasks could not be found. Unemployment, insecurity, want, dragged on. This is a puzzling paradox. At certain times a nation can afford what at other times, with no less money, it cannot afford. At certain times we are afraid of national bankruptcy, and at other times we give it hardly a thought.\n\nhttps://t.co/4UDLi8p6qD",

    "id": "1678084160408420352",
    "fullText": "THE NETWORK WAR\n\nI really like @eugenewei\u2019s writing, and recommend you read his piece. But I\u2019d argue it misses the core point of the last few years.\n\nNamely, that this isn\u2019t primarily a product conversation anymore. We\u2019re in the middle of the Network War, where all previously neutral institutions \u2014 online and offline \u2014 are captured by one tribe to be wielded against other tribes.\n\nYes, that\u2019s Twitter and Facebook and Google \u2014 but it\u2019s also the media, the courts, the dollar, the banking system, and the international rules-based order itself.\n\nEvery one of these institutions and more besides is caught in the middle of a massive multiplayer battle. There are at least 2-3 main combatants within the US (blues, reds, and tech) and many more internationally (like China, Russia, and India). More if you count Bitcoin and crypto as independent tribes.\n\nJust like physical territory can switch hands multiple times during the course of an offline war, digital territory can switch hands in an online war. And both can get damaged in the process \u2014 causing some of the issues Eugene describes.\n\nBut unlike a physical war, this network war is a battle for minds, not lands. Winning digital territory means the CEO is tweeting your memes and the brand is flying your colors. The digital battlefield is of real-world importance, because if you flip enough people online \u2014 enough users, enough capital \u2014 you change the world offline. The keyboard is often mightier than the sword.\n\nAnyway \u2014 the point is that Twitter started to become a battleground in 2013. It\u2019s more optimized for being a battleground than perhaps any other forum. That is its emergent purpose: to facilitate player-vs-player online, the endless war of all against all.\n\nAnd the capture of that battleground itself by Elon was a meta-move that was theoretically permissible by the rules of the game, but something perhaps only the richest man in the world could pull off.\n\nEverything else Eugene is (justifiably!) complaining about is a side effect of being caught in the middle of that digital battlefield, in the middle of the Network War.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the current owner made all the right moves, but he did successfully push back on a nightmarish 1984-like style of speech and thought controls that was being imposed on a previously free society, as documented here[1].\n\nThose who abetted this inside and outside Twitter have now been exposed by the Twitter Files, stripped of their blue checks, repudiated by the courts[2], and deprived of their online influence \u2014 though it was already in freefall beforehand[3]. This is much more important than the details of the chronological feed, in my view at least.\n\nThat said: I\u2019m completely sympathetic to people who\u2019ve found themselves caught in the middle of this, though this war has been raging for at least 10 years now. And if you want to hang out with your friends in a moderated space, or build decentralized alternatives, that\u2019s completely reasonable and a good course of action.\n\nBut Twitter itself shouldn\u2019t really be analyzed as a product. It\u2019s a digital warzone. And that war is only going to heat up as we move into 2024.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/38kHw6UKFO\n[2]: https://t.co/i9OQDIEfos\n[3]: https://t.co/mCPSi9xyND",

    "fullText": "Here, I\u2019m using narrative in the broader sense of the overarching story that defines the self-understanding of a group.\n\nJust like many people are mono-lingual, many people are mono-narrative. And they can\u2019t learn new ones after a certain age.\n\nMoreover, just like some languages are easier to pick up if you know English, while others are more distant, some narratives are closer in ideology space and others are further.\n\nThis is an explanation for why people can understand one political narrative, but not another. Or why the gold narrative is adjacent to the Bitcoin narrative, and why both can be hard to understand for people raised fiat-monolingual.\n\nA narrative requires space in your brain roughly comparable to a dialect.\n\nIt is partly literally linguistic \u2014 there are phrases that are characteristic of some ideological positions, like \u201cfiat\u201d. But it\u2019s also cultural, historical, moral, and social.\n\nThe way in which it\u2019s related to language is that you need to really immerse yourself in a narrative\u2019s premises to be able to speak fluently to someone else with that narrative.\n\nIf you foot fault on a phrase \u2014 for example saying \u201cCCP\u201d rather than \u201cCPC\u201d is a tell in China \u2014 then you\u2019re speaking the narrative with a strong accent. Maybe so strong that the other side won\u2019t listen anymore.\n\nPS: You could start quantifying this by using LLMs to rewrite text in different styles.\n\nAs we get better at explaining models, perhaps we can see what parts of the model are activated for different narratives, and what the underlying training corpora was for those different parts.\n\nIf the model needs be to trained on books 1-100 to speak in this way, but 101-200 to speak in another way, that\u2019s good evidence that acquisition of another narrative is nontrivial.",

    "fullText": "IS THREADS A THREAT?\n\nFacebook\u2019s clones of Snapchat and TikTok have been fairly successful, but haven\u2019t killed either Snapchat or TikTok. I think that\u2019s the base case.\n\nAn alternative scenario is Google Plus, which came out strong but didn\u2019t have staying power. But Facebook has far more social DNA than Google ever did.\n\nIt may boil down to whether Instagram users really want to post to a *new* social network.\n\nThat is, why not just implement Threads as a new tab within Instagram? Like Instagram added TikTok-like short videos.\n\nI\u2019m sure that was discussed internally as an alternative to doing Threads. One reason is that launching Threads as a new app certainly gets more attention, and maybe pulls in some disaffected Twitter users who want a different moderation policy.\n\nThe thing is \u2014 Instagram is for people who go outside. It\u2019s just a totally different culture of good-looking, well-adjusted, visually-oriented people. Very different culturally from Twitter\u2019s endless political warfare.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens when the kind of person who left Musk for Mastodon tries out Threads\u2026and is suddenly digitally surrounded by fitness influencers and models.\n\nCome for the moderation, stay for the muscles?",

    "fullText": "At a minimum, hundreds of institutions[1] have problems \u2014 which should tell you that it wasn\u2019t trivial to \u201cmanage duration risk\u201d of this magnitude.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1) You can hedge a move to say 1.1% from 1%, but not 1% to 5% in a year\n\n2) Hedging is also expensive, complex, and gives up scarce margin\n\n3) Hedging didn\u2019t seem necessary in 2021 because you\u2019d had 10 years of low/zero rates and a strong commitment from the Fed to keep them low indefinitely[2]\n\n4) More than that: the Fed said inflation was a conspiracy theory in 2021, so it was low status to hedge!\n\n5) Put all that together. Most banks are run by risk averse NPC committees these days. You think that in mid 2021 they were going to spend a big chunk of their margin hedging a risk that hadn\u2019t happened for 10 years that the Fed told them repeatedly wouldn\u2019t happen?\n\n6) Moreover, hedging just moves risk from one guy to another. Someone is stuck holding these horrible bonds. It doesn\u2019t fix the devaluation\n\n7) And in many cases the rulebook won\u2019t let you hedge, eg if you have moved them into hold to maturity you can\u2019t sell them\n\n8) Finally, duration risk isn\u2019t really duration risk in this case, it\u2019s devaluation  policy. Look at Powell\u2019s comments in 2012 \u2014 he knew rate hikes would cause massive losses after big bond sales.\n\nEtc etc. TLDR: all the hedging duration risk stuff is 20/20 hindsight. It\u2019s like asking five years from now \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you hedge debasement risk\u201d, as if debasement was a establishment-approved thing to hedge.\n\n[1]: see below\n[2]: https://t.co/qDpLWl2lPI\n[3]: https://t.co/vnmLxH5Y7w",

    "id": "1675990926165168128",
    "fullText": "HOW THE FED F\u2019ED INSURANCE\n\nIt\u2019s quite likely that many insurance companies are underwater. But if so, that\u2019s the fault of the Fed, not Florida.\n\nWhy? Well, one of the insurance companies named below is American Coastal. And Weiss Ratings reports[0] they put 77% of their portfolio into safe, investment-grade bonds. Problem is, thanks to the Fed, bonds are no longer safe.\n\nSee, many institutions bought supposedly safe bonds from the government in 2021.[1] But then that same government did a massive surprise devaluation[2] of all of the bonds it had just sold \u2014 screwing over its biggest customers, from banks to insurance companies, causing the largest losses in bond history[3], and saddling institutions what Stanford researchers estimate to be literally trillions[4] in unrealized losses.\n\nThese bond losses remain \u201cunrealized\u201d so long as people don\u2019t come looking for their money. But when they do \u2014 like during a bank run when banks must pay out, or during hurricane season when insurance companies must fork over cash \u2014 then bad assets are sold and losses become \u201crealized.\u201d\n\nAnd then we all \u201crealize\u201d that the poor dumb institutions that bought US government bonds in 2021 are actually insolvent \u2014 unless the Fed prints to paper over a bond crisis the Fed itself caused. Which it will do, over and over again, until the crisis devalues the dollar itself.\n\nAnyway, this is what happened in March 2022 when five huge banks died[5] in quick succession, followed by a quick print[6] to cover up the Fed\u2019s failure. This is why Roubini[7] is saying \u201cmost\u201d banks are insolvent, why Germany\u2019s central bank apparently has negative equity[8], and why Bank of America has $100B in unrealized losses[9].\n\nThis is all just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nJerome Powell and Janet Yellen are bond villains. They destroyed every institution that trusted their words in 2021. They said inflation was transitory and that they\u2019d keep rates low[10]. They sold billions in bonds on that false pretense. Then the Fed executed a surprise rate hike, devaluing all the bonds the government had just sold, and turning Treasuries into the new toxic waste.\n\nI wrote all this up here[2] and here[11], even mentioning insurance companies as bust months ago. The thing to understand is that this financial hurricane won\u2019t be limited to Florida.\n\n[0]: https://t.co/tPU8F72r1U\n[1]: https://t.co/BLBIu0BnFW\n[2]: https://t.co/rvWy62IFfe\n[3]: https://t.co/pDpitBEgFE\n[4]: https://t.co/pE2EeMNcka\n[5]: https://t.co/5sXWrma6Lm\n[6]: https://t.co/P0b3lFtLzb\n[7]: https://t.co/cwvauOO2MG\n[8]: https://t.co/AxcrUmOWa9\n[9]: https://t.co/v4dK3tsz2N\n[10]: https://t.co/kbOOv8L4Na\n[11]: https://t.co/UR1R0LtTtf",

If so that reduces the risk of live virus exposure (but perhaps also the perceived need for new vaccines).\n\nAlso, even if this experiment is in theory redundant with existing data (a) it's cheap relative to the cost of having mass distrust in public health and (b) we should be funding way more replication studies anyway given the broader replication crisis.\n\nhttps://t.co/VMHdHKZVB5",

Remember, they never go after their own bosses, like Sulzberger, or even mention them.\n\nAnd so long as tech was a net positive for media, as it was through 2008, they were optimistic on technological progress. But once tech started eating their lunch, media went all Black Mirror. \n\nBasically, everyone screwed this up and plunged the world into a global digital war which is still underway. Maybe it was inevitable, due to decentralization; one can make that argument. Or maybe some kind of deal between tech and media could have mitigated the transition in the early 2010s.\n\nAnyway, with Steve Jobs\u2019 passing tech lost its diplomat, so this kind of deal wasn\u2019t on the table.\n\n[1]: See for example this piece by @benthompson, where media corporations admit to attacking their tech competitors to get money from them.\nhttps://t.co/mknMLe0kOH",

Tech thought content was a dead end after Terry Semel[1], so they focused on the hard task of building pipes and just let users supply content[2]. Media though tech was a dead end after dotcom crash, so they focused on blowing up Iraq.\n\n2) 2008-2012: tech soared and took ~$50B in media revenue after the financial crisis\n\n3) 2013: media needed tech to re-elect Obama[3], but then after the 2012 election they brought the knives out\n\n4) 2013-2020: seven years of techlash from the media, to demonize the sector that was disrupting them and colonize it with establishment-sympathetic figures\n\n5) 2021: pyrrhic victory, with the establishment capturing Google and big tech at the expense of spending down their trust[4], alienating founders and investors of the next generation, and losing their best writers like @ggreenwald and @mtaibbi\n\n6) 2022: return of the founder, with Elon, Jack, Zuck and others asserting themselves in different ways. Tech also built and scaled its own media outlets over this time period, particular on podcasts and Twitter where legacy wasn\u2019t as strong\n\n7) 2023+: the combination of generative AI, decentralized social media, a billion Indians coming online, and more means legacy media is finished, so battleground is moving to the legacy financial system\n\nTLDR: tech wrecked the business model of legacy media, and thus started receiving negative coverage.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/7oseILD82a\n\n[2]: https://t.co/N72g6CwXE3\n\n[3]: https://t.co/cQGwyMBkcN\n\n[4]: https://t.co/RPMWLD7Niv",

    "fullText": "CHEATING DEATH IS GOOD\n\nPeople often associate performance enhancing drugs with \u201ccheating\u201d. And of course it\u2019s true that if you\u2019re an athlete it\u2019s cheating and against the rules. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with cheating death.\n\nPut another way: Lance Armstrong shouldn\u2019t have won the Tour De France, but his chemists could have won the Nobel Prize for medicine.\n\nHow did they bring a man back from testicular cancer[1] to \u201cwinning\u201d seven championships against likely drug-aided competitors?\n\nTake the athletic competition out of the picture for a second. Many cancer patients would like to know what exactly Lance Armstrong\u2019s regimen was.\n\nYes, it\u2019s some mix of EPO, Andriol, cortisone, HGH, and actovegin.[2] (Note in particular the apparent efficacy of blood transfusions, another signal for the @bryan_johnson / parabiosis school of thought!)\n\nBut I haven\u2019t seen the full clinical writeup, let alone a proposed scaling of this (or similar) interventions to other cancer patients that want to get back to top condition.\n\nPartly this is because the conventional wisdom is that performance enhancing drugs are always life shortening, that there are side effects and trade offs, that there is no free lunch, that Lance will now die sooner, etc.\n\nBut we should be skeptical of this kind of Icarus instinct. Trying to fly doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your wings will fall off. We fly every day.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s not obvious that we\u2019re anywhere close to Pareto optimal health. There is likely enormous room for improvement given modern technology. We just sequenced the genome 20 years ago. We\u2019re at the beginning of the human self-improvement arc.\n\nSo: what if the kind of treatments that these athletes get might be more broadly useful to society? What if you could monitor and engineer away the side effects?\n\nWe\u2019ve managed to do that for many other drugs, like folk remedies where we figured out the active ingredient.\n\nIt\u2019s worth thinking about.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/ddbvDIQz6q\n[2]: https://t.co/ih87KzQwXm",

    "fullText": "SCIENCE > CENSORSHIP\n\n@fchollet is a wonderful engineer that's written a great AI book. But in his post, he compares discussing vaccines to supporting fascism.\n\nI can't agree. \n\n1) First, many of the vaccine-hesitant early on were actually African Americans that saw the shadow of Tuskegee in the COVID shots, as several outlets reported[1,2].\n\n2) Second, it's kind of weird to say that Nazism is both (a) mindlessly supporting a totalitarian state *and* (b) disobediently asking questions of your government.\n\n3) Third, and most obviously, many on the other side were *also* calling people Nazis for mandating injections while censoring speech. You aren't going to convince them by calling them Nazis back.\n\n4) Fourth, almost 50% of civil servants were hesitant to take the vaccine at one point, which shows how deep the resistance was![3]\n\nSo: rather than the infinite loop of everyone calling each other Hitler till the end of time, why not a rational discussion?\n\nHOW YOU MIGHT DO THAT\nThing is, I\u2019m as pro-biotech as it gets. I was sticking my neck out to talk about COVID back when establishment journalists were calling everyone paranoid racists for mentioning it, because I do believe in the public good.[4] And the thing is: there is genuine scientific achievement here in terms of mRNA vaccines!\n\nSo: why seize defeat from the jaws of victory by yelling at people and pounding them with all manner of threats? I think I know why, unfortunately. It's because everything is tribal warfare now and every issue is politicized. Even if it should be positive-sum, it's made zero-sum or even negative-sum.\n\nStill, here's a sketch of how you might make the case.\n\n1) First, go through all the observational studies, where you show relative morbidity and mortality for vaccinated and non-vaccinated, with every covariate, and the raw data publicly available for re-analysis.\n\n2) Then, if people still disagree, maybe you can conduct a challenge trial[5], where group A opts in to being exposed to live virus and group B to getting the vaccine. Yeah, I know, there is risk. \n\nBut (a) this is actually what science is (namely  controlled experiments) and (b) this is already being done de facto at the level of society as a whole, with millions of people exposing themselves to live virus. So we might as well get it over with in a small group that\u2019s opted in. Think of them as military heros if you want, as they'd be taking a conscious risk to help save other people's lives.\n\n3) Finally, who knows \u2014\u00a0maybe you can even do something with organoids where you don\u2019t need to expose an individual to either live virus *or* vaccine right away, but can instead take a tissue sample and establish a patient-specific organoid and test on that, as a proxy for the patient themselves. Looks like there's some promising initial work on that[6], though it probably wouldn't substitute for the challenge trial.\n\nAll this starts putting us in the realm of scientific discussion, as befits a serious matter of public health. Or, you know, everyone can just call each other Hitler forever.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/XATZkNSOGt\n[2]: https://t.co/ZWRLlCSfLV\n[3]: https://t.co/dQexHOuWgw\n[4]: https://t.co/f2P5kwiEzV\n[5]: https://t.co/20f4EXuX22\n[6]: https://t.co/aWNLMcIboc\n[7]: https://t.co/8JVoMneH9r",

Taliban was much weaker.\n\n4) The best NATO can do right now is supply Ukraine with tons of money and ammo. They have spent $100B directly and $800B on energy subsidies indirectly to deal with the war fallout, plus I\u2019m sure a lot more.\n\n5) Nevertheless, by many reports, including their own, some of which are excerpted below, NATO is now running low on ammo.\n\n6) So this is close to the maximum force NATO can *realistically* deploy against Russia via Ukrainians given the deindustrialized state of the West.\n\n7) And you can\u2019t compare it to a comic book scenario where NATO actually tries to fight Russia directly. That would quickly go nuclear.\n\n8) So, actually existing NATO in the actually existing war is running low on ammo for actually existing Ukraine, against an adversary (Russia) that\u2019s much weaker than China.\n\n9) Does this have any implications for whether the US can take on China in Taiwan, which could be a similar proxy war against a far stronger industrial goliath? \n\nOne might think so.",

The demographics means the biggest rival will fall into a ditch. The economics means no one can replace the dollar. The politics doesn\u2019t mean anything, and that\u2019s just the mess of our beautiful system anyway.\n\nBasically: it\u2019s a unipolar world, still a huge lead, will be forever, and you can keep screwing up indefinitely without consequence \u2014 including another multi-trillion dollar print on the scale of 2008 or beyond \u2014 due to the enormous advantage afforded by technology, geography, etc.\n\nHowever if you take the other view \u2014 if you think that fiat currency is backed by men with guns, and that both the currency and the guns are looking quite iffy these days \u2014 then you need to start thinking about how to defend freedom if history follows an unexpected branch.",

    "fullText": "Yeah, but I think it's worth thinking through.\n\n1) 140M Russians (including many who were against the war) were summarily deplatformed from a variety of tech services in March 2022. For Google, with 4B+ users, that was just a few % of their users. They could blackhole an entire country without much consequence. So they might be able to do it to 500M crypto holders.\n\n2) Or think about social media before 2016. Twitter used to call itself the \"free speech wing of the free speech party\". Then from 2016 till 2022, the speech controls came fast and furious, once states felt that social media actually threatened them.\n\nIn 2021 in particular, the CEOs of major tech companies were encouraged to deplatform a sitting president and his supporters in order to keep the republic going. And they did so.\n\n3) In my view, we are at the beginning of a complicated dance between the state and the network on cryptocurrency. Some states will be rabidly against, some will be vocally for, some states will be for only *some* networks, and so on.\n\nIf you analyze the battlefield, though, the most important underappreciated technical threat out there in my view isn't the NSA or CCP \u2014\u00a0but Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nIf the CEOs of those three companies are ordered by DC to seize private keys in order to keep the US financial system running...if cryptocurrency becomes as financially important as social media is politically important...what'll happen?\n\n4) I'm not saying the answer is purely technological. It may include political components, that deter Apple from trying such a thing in (say) Texas or El Salvador or UAE for fear of having other penalties applied to it.\n\nIt might include moral components, or societal components, though those might only be as binding as Twitter's \"commitment\" to free speech.\n\nI do think we should think about it.",

That means pointing all its gizmos on dissidents at home, like the Canadian truckers times 1000.\n\n4) But even at home, red and purple states are breaking away. It's not just sanctuary cities and drug laws. It's gun laws, abortion laws, crypto laws, education laws. States are openly defying the feds. And there's no upper bound here; Florida is building its own military, for example[6].\n\n5) So, while it'll be messy, I generally think freedom will win because DC won't win everywhere. The only ones subject to DC's rule will then be those that trust DC to the end.

    "fullText": "This is a deep question. My short response is that I\u2019d have agreed with you 75 years ago but not today.\n\nJust as preface, I take zero pleasure in any of these observations. I\u2019m a win/win person and the ideal would have been for the West to continue improving even as India also got its act together. But that\u2019s not what I see.\n\nWith that said, the longer response:\n\n1) India at the time of independence was a collection of princely states with no prior history of union before the British Raj. And it wasn\u2019t trivial for Sardar Patel and others to unify it and forge a cohesive national identity. But today to my great surprise India is in the middle of its centralization arc, and is perhaps the most unified it\u2019s ever been.\n\n2) The US in the 1950s was similar to India in the 2020s \u2014 a polyglot mixture of ethnic groups from across a continent that was nevertheless unified by nationalism and cultural similarities.\n\nThe most obvious signal of practical unity is that today\u2019s India and the DC of the 1950s could cost-effectively build public works (the Golden Quadrilateral, the Interstate Highway System), but the India of the past and the DC of the present could not (the License Raj, the California High Speed Rail).\n\n3) The US of the present resembles the India of the past, in a reversal that I would have thought improbably bizarre even 10-15 years ago.\n\nIndia had an absolutely world class group of smart people trapped in a tragic commons and ruled by a dysfunctional state. It was the country  wracked by communal riots, socialist lunatics, and racialist obsessions. And it gave birth to an impressive diaspora, exiting economic craziness and ethnic conflict. Now that sounds like California.\n\n4) Finally, regarding the US of the distant past, it actually *was* essentially 13 separate countries at the time of independence. See video below starting at 0:48.\n\n\u201cIt's important to remember that the United States of America was not originally a single country. It was a collection of 13 separate countries. The 13 colonies that were participating in the rebellion had each been separate from each other, distinct colonies with ties between themselves and Britain, but not really ties amongst themselves, between the different colonies.\n\nSo when the 13 colonies declared their independence, they did so not as a single unified country but as 13 separate countries in association with each other \u2014 what we would today call an international organization \u2014 in\norder to accomplish their common goal.\u201d\nhttps://t.co/Ya9vhloL3G",

Industrial policy is like venture capital, it\u2019s easy to spend money but very hard to do profitably.\n\n3) Third, stop pushing countries to decouple because they will be forced to choose China over the US \u2014 or else they don\u2019t get countless basic physical goods.\n\n4) Fourth, start thinking about what a realistic solution looks like given those constraints. \n\nReshoring manufacturing would probably mean AI-based factories with heavy use of robots, along with radical changes to building codes, labor law, and environmental regulations. So, that right there is arguably politically impossible in the current climate.\n\nYou\u2019d want to combine that with a modest foreign policy that avoids provoking a war that you can\u2019t win, until you\u2019ve spent literally decades rebuilding your strength.\n\nSo, this is also probably impossible because many people don\u2019t want to hear that their military isn\u2019t infinitely physically powerful, and indeed is arguably the underdog.\n\nBut hey, at least a note of realism was sounded.",

It didn\u2019t take center stage.\n\nBut Twitter was what the 2016 election was truly about. Because Twitter led to not just Trump, but Brexit, Bolsonaro, and left and right populists around the world. It allowed non-mainstream voices without any corporate media support to be heard, for good or ill.\n\nAfter 2016 the establishment suddenly took Twitter seriously and began a massive campaign to censor and throttle it, one that was reversed by Elon\u2019s purchase in 2022 \u2014 though we still need decentralized media to prevent a recurrence.\n\nNow, in 2023 we are on the verge of US sovereign default and fiat crisis. If you think partisan animosity is hot now, what if the everything bubble pops well before the election? There are a variety of scenarios where a new Executive Order 6102 \u2014 or equivalent attempt at asset seizure \u2014 becomes a primary political issue. \n\nAnd then Bitcoin, once dismissed as a fad and bubble, may become what 2024 is all about: the right to hold Bitcoin shall not be infringed\u2026\n\nRead about the Gold Clause cases of 1933-1935 to see how hot this got a century ago. This time we may see the opposite outcome, where the centralized state loses. https://t.co/yl0MCTRrlg",

    "id": "1659585437038702593",
    "fullText": "DON'T GO FROM WOKISM TO JINGOISM\n\nMany people are critical of wokism.\nAnd they should be.\nWokism simply denies many domestic realities.\nBut a militaristic, nationalistic jingoism is also bad.\nBecause it denies many foreign realities.\nIf wokism is Democrat PC...\nThen jingoism is Republican PC.\n\nWhat are the foreign realities that jingoism denies?\n\n1) That the US failed in the forever wars, killed a lot of people unnecessarily, burnt insane amounts of money, and should at least reflect on this.\n\n2) That US foreign policy was on balance better than the USSR from 1945-1991, but gradually turned destructive after that, and since 2003 has arguably done more harm than good \u2014\u00a0particularly in the Middle East \u2014\u00a0to the US as well as the world.\n\n3) That as a consequence, many countries no longer consider the US to be the guarantor of order that it was during the Cold War, but an agent of anarchy. For example, this is why legislators in Germany have accused the US of doing the Nord Stream bombing and want it to pull out troops.[1]\n\n4) That the US is not the manufacturing powerhouse it used to be, that it couldn't financially nuke Russia into submission[2], and that it's finding it hard to produce enough ammo to beat Russia[3], let alone China. \n\n5) That now Kupchan in CFR[4] and Blinken[5] have essentially said they're going to sue for peace with Russia over Ukraine, involving China as a partner.\n\n6) That China is actually extremely strong in manufacturing capability, with 10-100X advantages over the US in many key areas like steel and shipbuilding[6]. \n\n7) That the US is unfortunately no longer the manufacturing superpower[7] it was in WW2, and may not be able to win[8] a prolonged conventional war with China at the present time, so should think twice about it. It's like fighting your factory \u2014\u00a0it's not even about high-tech, China can screw you by withholding screws.\n\n8) Finally, just as it was completely possible to be both (a) against Al Qaeda and (b) against the Iraq War and (c) for surgical counterterrorism instead, it's possible to be both (a) against the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Chinese surveillance state while (b) also supporting moves towards peace with Russia [like even Kupchan[4] and Blinken[5] now do] and avoiding confrontation with China.\n\n9) The goal instead should be to build economic and manufacturing capability peacefully to once again become an admirable country and thereby restore soft power.\n\n10) Fundamentally, it is the erosion of US soft power \u2014 quality manufacturing, respected media, a stable financial system \u2014  that has led to the overreliance on hard power.\n\nBasically, China used to respect the US but doesn't anymore[9] after 2020, because they feel they are domestically out-executing the US.\n\nThe way to turn that around is not by shooting guns, but by building buildings. Build a clean, futuristic, admirable[10] society that is once again the wonder of the world. Then everyone will want to emulate the US.\n\nThat's neither wokism nor jingoism. Neither riots nor bombings. It's not denying domestic or foreign realities. You need to embrace the constraints of reality to build an admirable society.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/hiwEMnP7iT\n[2]: https://t.co/JaXmRzo50f\n[3]: https://t.co/X2boV5wN8p\n[4]: https://t.co/kyX7CE6KAM\n[5]: https://t.co/r95A1XOpq9\n[6]: https://t.co/XErLU6GvLL\n[7]: https://t.co/fB07rhQek1\n[8]: https://t.co/NdcriE0BFV\n[9]:  https://t.co/vX35YdVSvU\n[10]: https://t.co/YpCA2oMUBl",

    "id": "1659463031884230657",
    "fullText": "STOPPING THE BACKDOOR ATTACK\n\nIn 2010, even after Twitter and Facebook helped catalyze the Arab Spring, people still would have thought it implausible if you'd said \"in ten years, the most important political issue in the world for a few days will be whether the President of the United States could tweet.\"\n\nBut it was.\n\nSimilarly, in 2023, even after El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin, people still think it's implausible to say \"by the end of this decade, the most important political issue in the world may be whether bankrupt governments have sufficient Bitcoin to fund their operations.\"\n\nBut it could be.\n\nAnd in such a circumstance, what will desperate governments do? As of 2023, I don't think the conventional 51% attack by mining is something the US government could easily pull off. Maybe China could, but most mining is now outside China.\n\nInstead, the federal government may try to compel Apple and Google (and other tech companies) to hunt for private keys on the servers, devices, and browsers they control. And to remit any stolen funds to a cash-hungry federal government.\n\nThis isn't cyberterrorism, it's cyberwar. It's not some random hacker who manages to sneak out a file. It's when the CEO of a company gives the lawful order to to hack their customers. This is similar to what happened to 140M Russians designated enemies of the state in early 2022 \u2014 every tech company turned on their former customers.\n\nWhat's the possible target? We're talking billions of iPhones and Android phones, Mac laptops and Chrome browsers, Google Docs and Gmail. China could do the same with the Chinese smartphone manufacturers.\n\nWhat's the possible defense? This is a tough situation. It's quite possible Tim Cook stands up to the pressure. He's been good on end-to-end encryption and stood up to the establishment on the CSAM on-device scanning initiative[1], which was an obvious way to get the snout under the tent.\n\nIf you can't trust the operating system itself, things get tricky. Linux is an answer but Linux devices may not scale in time. Exchanges built on Linux are another possible answer, but those are of course custodial and possibly also vulnerable to similar attacks.\n\nI don't have all the answers, but I want to raise the question to get us to start thinking about it. It's possible that the answer here is in part social or political, not simply technological. \n\n[1]: https://t.co/k5bihogT8v",

  "2023-05-17|REPUTATION, REGULATION, AND POWER  Just the fact t": {
    "id": "1658657270119686144",
    "fullText": "REPUTATION, REGULATION, AND POWER\n\nJust the fact that the SEC is fighting means it is losing. Why?\n\nBecause the regulatory state\u2019s power is a function of its reputation. Carpenter wrote the canonical book[1] on this in the context of the FDA, but the concepts also apply to the SEC.\n\nIn short, for decades after its creation, the regulatory state expected \u2014 and obtained \u2014 absolute acquiescence.\n\nWhen it even *gestured* at a company, it was like a ringwraith extending its finger in the Lord of the Rings. Everything around that company shriveled and died. Employees left, investors sold, customers bailed.\n\nOh, and the media denounced. Indeed, the media was a laser spotter for the regulatory state. Typically an organization like the SEC worked with friendly reporters to leak an investigation beforehand, softening up a target with press airstrikes before the state moved in.\n\nThe goal was to strip all sympathy from the ostensible corporate criminal, to try them in the court of public opinion, and to not incidentally advance the careers of reporter and regulator alike. Pulitzers and promotions all around; who cares if the target was framed.\n\nBut now in the year of our lord Satoshi 2023, things have changed.\n\nFirst, the 20th century regulatory state was premised on concentration. The SEC is built to regulate Goldman and Morgan, not 1000 crypto holders. The FDA is set up for Pfizer and Merck, not 1000 biohackers. And the FAA is meant for Boeing and Airbus, not 1000 drone hobbyists. The sheer number of targets in our decentralized era means this archaic giant is fruitlessly swatting flies.\n\nSecond, the IQ of the regulatory state has dropped off a cliff relative to their targets. If you really understand a space, \ndo you want to be a builder/investor, or a hater/regulator (but I repeat myself)? There\u2019s more fun and upside in building than destroying. Our good fortune is that regulatory arsonists get paid less than firefighters.\n\nThird, the fact that agents of the state must argue their case on social media \u2014 where citizens can talk back, and where corporate journalists no longer have special privileges \u2014 this is an enormous fall from grace. The unelected agents of the regulatory state are finally facing digital democracy.\n\nFourth, the technologies themselves have been engineered for censorship-resistance, incentivized uptake, and global adoption. Which means other jurisdictions both inside and outside the US are diverging from the federal government, from Texas to the EU.\n\nFinally, the majority of global GDP and population is now outside the US, and the endless domestic and foreign political conflict of the last 10 years means the regulatory state no longer controls a lion\u2019s share of the global market at home or abroad.\n\nI haven\u2019t even gotten to other factors, like the potential overturn of Chevron deference, or the return of self-confident/self-made founders after decades of gelded general managers.\n\nBut that\u2019s why the state is losing. If you plot sentiment towards regulation since 2010, their reputation \u2014 and hence their power \u2014 is sharply down and to the right.\n\nStill, they are fighting.\n\nMy view is that they end up with more power over fewer people. Extremely harsh crypto regulations that are only obeyed in the bluest of blue states \u2014 and actively disregarded by everyone else, both inside and outside the US, much like sanctuary city laws override federal immigration law and foreign countries set their own policies.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to fight \u2014 you do. It just means that you can win. Because the arc of history is long, but it now bends toward decentralization.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/FsIR8s2phU",

If you can print infinite money, you can buy all the military gear and personnel you need. Conversely if you have an invincible military, you can force anyone to accept your printed currency.\n\nIn other words, fiat money is backed by men with guns.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/chxotQe8Wk",

    "id": "1658562980546756609",
    "fullText": "ON GOLD\nSome thoughts on gold.\n\n1) Gold is clearly already making a comeback at the state level. See attached image below.\n\nIf you\u2019re China and Saudi Arabia for example, you can afford the overhead of settling up in physical gold bullion every so often. States can afford the security guards, the warehouses, the verification overhead to confirm purity, etc.\n\n2) But for non-state investors, it doesn\u2019t seem to make sense to buy non-custodial gold (like GLD). Such assets can be seized with a keypress, as happened to the Russians, the Canadian truckers, or even the Credit Suisse bondholders. It can also be manipulated via derivatives and the like.\n\n3) All right, then what about actually buying and holding physical gold bullion as a retail investor? You can do this, but there are pros and cons.\n\nThe pro is that gold has been valuable for millennia and has outlasted every civilization. It can\u2019t crash like software. It\u2019s not easily lost. You\u2019ll know if it\u2019s stolen. And everyone gets it.\n\nThe con is that gold is heavy and hard to transport. It\u2019ll show up on metal detectors if you get on a plane. It\u2019s illiquid relative to digital currency \u2014 and, when combined with the transportation issues, makes it difficult or even unsafe to sell in exigent circumstances. Finally, governments willing to exert sufficient force can seize physical gold as well, as they did during executive order 6102.\n\n4) For these reasons, gold seems like it will be more useful for states (especially non-Western) than for individuals.\n\n@LukeGromen and @PeterSchiff may have thoughts.",

    "id": "1658246262498660352",
    "fullText": "BLUE AMERICA ISN'T SENDING THEIR BEST\n\nThe key concept that many Red Americans don't get is that Blue America is why Latin America is so poor.\n\nWhy is LatAm sending migrants to the US? Because blues like Chesa Boudin helped turn Venezuela into a hellhole. Yeah, he served in the Chavez administration[1] before he screwed up San Francisco! That's the modern version of the Monroe Doctrine: blue colonialism, without any roads and bridges, but with NGO sinecures and blue saviors.\n\nBut once you yeet the blues out of LatAm countries, things miraculously recover. Just look at El Salvador without the influence of Blue America! They got their murder rate to zero once they got blue influence out of their country.\n\nI agree this is not obvious until you dig into it. But as a plausibility argument, just think about what NGOs have done to San Francisco, and realize that they're doing that to Latin America and Africa.\n\nOr look at El Salvador. Why are blues futilely attacking @nayibbukele now, after years of not caring about El Salvador, now that he's finally restoring order and prosperity to the place?[2]\n\nBecause blues from the US and Europe did to Latin America what they did to Russia, China, India, and so many other places \u2014 they exported socialism and communism, and thereby turned those places into hellholes & economic basketcases where people had to escape. Then they turn around and often turn the children of the refugees fleeing their handiwork into blue voters. It's an amazing double whammy.\n\nAfter all, it's Herbert Matthews[3] who helped turn Cuba into a hellhole. It's also John Reed[4], Edgar Snow[5], Walter Duranty[6], David Halberstam[7], and so many others who did the same to the rest of the world. Look for a communist or socialist dictator anywhere in the world, and you'll usually find a Blue American backing him.\n\nReturning to LatAm: to solve the issue of migrant laborers, Red Americans doesn't need to blame the poor migrants. Instead, work with Latin American leaders like Bukele to restore order so people don't need to leave. That means deporting Blue American NGOs from Latin America. Because the US isn't sending its best.\n\nCITATIONS\n[1]: Chesa, Chavez official: https://t.co/16mjdQNfLW\n[2]: Bukele on ending gangs: https://t.co/wcH9lu6IzL\n[3]: Herbert Matthews, Castro's journalist https://t.co/cYcQSApBVI\n[4]: John Reed, Lenin's journalist https://t.co/tVICX1qA9R \n[5]: Edgar Snow, Mao's journalist https://t.co/GUosZPjJuZ\n[6]: Walter Duranty, Stalin's journalist https://t.co/ArJznZhHrS \n[7]: David Halberstam, Ho Chi Minh's journalist https://t.co/MuA6q21kve",

    "id": "1657894706276368385",
    "fullText": "What's his substantive counterargument?[0]\n\n\"The Fed's asset sales don't belong to Treasury and the Fed's prohibited by the Federal Reserve Act from gifting them to Treasury.\"\n\nC'mon, let's not pretend here! Krugman[5] just admitted the other day in the context of minting the coin that:\n\n\"...when the Fed sells off some of its bond portfolio, it\u2019s just as if the Treasury Department were selling debt the usual way.\" \n\nIn other words, there's no real difference between the Fed selling assets and Treasury selling bonds \u2014\u00a0both are controlled by the same federal government, like two checking accounts owned by the same guy, which belies the idea that the \"asset sales don't belong to Treasury.\"\n\nPoint: Krugman agreed there are workarounds to get around any nominal Fed/Treasury walls. Now we're just talking about details.\n\nDETAILS\n1) Fed and Treasury closely coordinate, as any layman can see from all the joint statements[1].\n\n2) Fed already sells assets and sends remittances to Treasury on an annual basis. See section 60.55 here[2], though Fed is operating at loss since 2022[3].\n\n3) Fed already prints money to give to banks, by buying overpriced assets from them[4], and it can \"request\" that banks then buy Treasuries in a variety of ways. There are existing Basel III regulations that require banks to buy \"high quality liquid assets\" like Treasuries \u2014\u00a0and then of course there are the verbal \"suggestions\" that any bank would take from its regulator to buy such assets on an immediate basis.\n\n4) The current rigmarole around the trillion dollar coin and premium bonds is only happening because the debt ceiling cuts off Treasury's normal bond-issuance capability, so some of the normal ways the Fed could work around this ostensible \"wall\" to funnel money to Treasury by buying bonds by proxy aren't available.\n\n5) But even then, everyone knows there isn't an impregnable wall between Treasury and Fed. Including Krugman[5] (see screenshot below). The whole trillion dollar coin thing is Treasury minting, depositing with the Fed, then crediting the Treasury. No wall between them in practice.\n\nTLDR: there are countless such hijinks that can and will be taken to get money from Fed to Treasury, even as people pretend they are impossible. Same as inflation, gas stoves, and everything else \u2014 it's not happening, until it is.\n\n[0]: https://t.co/UyPg2uEpQV\n[1]: https://t.co/JMCUXAH9gJ\n[2]: https://t.co/W3S4ntrgz7\n[3]: https://t.co/ZIjtT9vLpP\n[4]: https://t.co/3Yf0ZJhYn2\n[5]: https://t.co/GkSUpC0D3r",

It\u2019s not a banking crisis, it\u2019s a central banking crisis.\n\nDETAILS\nThe new tactic is to acknowledge the crisis is real, but blame institutions for failing to hedge \u201cduration risk\u201d.\n\nBut that\u2019s like telling people to buckle their seatbelts on a plane. Yes, that\u2019s normally a good practice! But useless when the pilot \u2014 Jerome Powell \u2014 is crashing the plane.\n\nBecause if you expect rates at 1% but they are at 1.2% \u2014 yes, an institution can hedge. That\u2019s normal turbulence. The pilot can expect each passenger to buckle their seatbelt.\n\nHowever if you expect rates at 1% and they get rammed to 5% \u2014 after Powell told everyone rates would remain low forever or at most gradually rise, as he did as late as Nov 3 2021 \u2014 then every bond buyer dies. It\u2019s like a pilot crashing the plane, and blaming passengers for not buckling their seatbelt.\n\n**You can\u2019t hedge a plane crash.** That\u2019s what\u2019s happened. This wasn\u2019t duration risk, it was devaluation policy.\n\nBecause the US government consciously sold billions of dollars in assets to banks that it then devalued.\n\nWe know it was conscious because Powell himself was aware of it in 2012! \n\n\u201c\u2026we look like we are blowing a fixed-income duration bubble right across the credit spectrum that will result in big losses when rates come up down the road.

    "id": "1656445968408285186",
    "fullText": "ASSET SALES PAID DEBTS\nNow, the next question is: how did Australia manage to pay down its debt? This source[1] says a good chunk of the debt was paid off via large asset sales. For example, the sale of Sydney Airport to a private consortium for $4.2B.\n\nThis is apparently a third option to pay debts. In addition to cutting spending and raising taxes, you can sell state-owned assets.\n\nMany countries around the world have done this, of course. They've sold land, railways, and airports and taken those costs off the public books.\n\nNow, who bought the assets? The immediate guess is China, but this was the early 2000s, and the Chinese didn't have as much money then. Some of the ones I looked at like the Sydney airport[2] don't seem to have been sold to China. There's a partial list here[3], so you can look for yourself.\n\nSELL LAND FOR SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES?\nYou might think that takes little bit of the coolness out of it. \"Oh, you're saying Australia did it by selling assets, not simply by tightening their belts in a smart way!\" And maybe so. But:\n\n1) The buyer of a state-owned asset need not be China  \u2014 it could be a private consortium or other approved buyers).\n\n2) The concept of \"asset sales\" as a proven way for in-debt Anglo countries to get out of debt may be important in the next few years\n\n3) The \"asset\" sold could include a license. For example, imagine you could buy a license for a few million dollars to build whatever you wanted on ten square miles of barren land. \n\nLike the joke: \"The Purge begins. Everything is legal for twelve hours. I immediately approve permits on a twelve story apartment building in south Berkeley.\"[4]\n\nObviously, buying not just land but a bit of sovereignty \u2014\u00a0buying the ability to build special economic zones without interference, while also renting basic police protection and the like \u2014\u00a0that could be very easy to sell and very valuable to buy.\n\n4) Depending on what happens over the next few years, the selling state might want to sell it for hard currency.\n\n5) And the selling state might even retain some kind of equity stake in the entity that now runs the land, to align incentives.\n\nSo: asset sales may be a preview of a way that states could pay their debts while legalizing physical innovation.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/qXTuM4TKwP\n[2]: https://t.co/53ws9bUw5o\n[3]: https://t.co/g7W0GrJVvW\n[4]: https://t.co/CGCnQ5CbIf",

  "2023-05-10|TLDR: against this state, not all states. Pragmati": {
    "id": "1656113000770850816",
    "fullText": "TLDR: against this state, not all states. Pragmatist, not anarchist.\n\nLonger version: centralization and decentralization are both tools. Right now we're seeing all the downsides of excess centralization in the West \u2014 a single point of failure on everything from fiat to FDA.\n\nAnd so that's resulting in a new wave of decentralization. Like the Printing Press and Reformation pulled power away from the Catholic Church, a combination of technological and political forces today are pulling power away from a calcified center that's stealing all the money without delivering any of the goods.\n\nBut then what? Pretty soon, people will find that many goods don't decompose entirely into pairwise transactions. Like, if you have 100 BTC in Syria, you want a peaceful walk down the street. Who do you pay to accomplish that? It's not something that trivially reduces to a single transaction.\n\nThat's a limit case, but there are many public goods like this that essentially boil down to the desire to live in a high-trust, polite society. If you want to put a market price on it, people will pay to live in such a society, to buy entry to such a place. But it's not something any one person can produce on their own. And it can't be produced purely by market forces \u2014 as the cliche goes, you need missionaries, not mercenaries.\n\nThat brings us to the other major public good, which is scale for defense reasons. We take this for granted today, but \"countries\" like France, Germany, and Italy are really rollups of many small states that got conquered and ideologically reprogrammed to become parts of gigastates. German nationalism was driven in part by the Napoleonic wars.[2] Get big or die \u2014\u00a0similar to America's join or die. That's the reason for the centralization arc of the last few centuries.\n\nBut of course, that can also result in join *and* die. Where a small state that joins a larger country (often involuntarily) doesn't benefit in the process and wants to break away. Like Eastern Europe and the Baltics did after the fall of the USSR. That's the decentralization arc of the last few decades.\n\nAs I study history I see centralization, decentralization, and then recentralization occuring over and over again. This is the line from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms:  \"the empire long united must divide, the empire long divided must unite.\"\n\nBut I don't think of it as purely cyclic \u2014\u00a0I think of it as a helical theory of history[1], with linear progress on a z-axis (such as technology) even as it's cyclic on others (such as political organization).\n\nOne last way of thinking about it \u2014\u00a0think about your steering wheel. Sometimes you steer left, and other times right. Similarly, sometimes you decentralize and other times you centralize, to build a society that people want to join rather than flee.\n\nAs an example, imagine a group of \u201cWestists\u201d who liked the idea of California. So they set out for the West, and their zeal got them to California. But then even after getting there, they kept going further to the West till they landed up in the Pacific. Anyone who protested was denounced as an Eastist cuck. They weren't true Westists, after all.\n\nThis shows both the benefit and the deficit of the ideologically driven Western style of thinking. The zeal got them out West. It achieved greatness! But then it put them into the drink, into the Pacific. Their zeal led to collapse.\n\nThere's more I could say, but basically if you've traveled to the East (or the broader ascending world), their civilizations are generally on the rise and they don't feel as much of a need to go all Sovereign Individual.\n\nAnd because they live in generally functional polities that have been improving over their lives, they will take exactly the opposite lesson from the Fed-driven collapse of Western states. They'll think \"boy, am I glad we have a functional state.\"\n\n[1]: https://t.co/Tm3AT347Ak\n[2]:",

    "id": "1656076558665404416",
    "fullText": "\ud83d\ude42 From my standpoint, I\u2019ve always understood these issues and been outspoken[1] about them years before most people got into the space.\n\nLot of things to respond to in your comment. Let me see if I can disentangle them. Please take no offense at what follows.\n\nI think many people in the space only focus on one narrative and go wrong that way. For example, either they are just ahistorical degens who don\u2019t get that their government may soon fail \u2014 or they are so \u201clibertarian\u201d that they are hostile to entrepreneurs and investors as a class.\n\nI think many tech companies have been corrupted by the US establishment, but didn\u2019t start out that way. Early Google was a champion of Linux and open source, early Twitter was the free speech wing of the free speech party.\n\nI think it\u2019s very challenging to build scalable businesses and I respect entrepreneurship. But I respect pure math and science even more; money is ultimately just a tool.\n\nI think VCs as a group are (by necessity) long term investors and are usually making primary investments in companies, meaning buying stock from a company directly in return for funding operations.\n\nI think some crypto market participants are projecting their own short-term behavior onto VCs \u2014 eg traditional VCs can\u2019t day trade and don\u2019t do lots of secondary sales. Crypto hedge funds do that.\n\nIn general, I think angels and VCs are the least bad category of investor because they are funding businesses directly, often in part with their own money, aligned for the long term, and making equity- rather than debt-based investments.\n\nI don\u2019t think that we are only going to have paper equity forever, and I think we will have other digital assets. I\u2018ve written about how we can bring concepts like lockups and disclosures to the on-chain environment. \n\nI don\u2019t think the answer is either to say \u201cno to everything\u201d or \u201cyes to everything\u201d but rather to develop a binary classifier with both low false positive and false negative rates, to filter good from bad projects.\n\nI think that Bitcoin is a necessary but not sufficient tool for human flourishing, similar to how gold was the pillar of previous financial systems but (obviously) not the entire thing.\n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s important that folks like you, Breedlove, and Saifedean have taken concepts from Rothbard/Mises/Hayek/et alia and modernized them via Bitcoin. Not to minimize that contribution at all, just to note there is a common thread.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I personally need to talk about these ideas all the time \u2014 on some level I think they are obvious \u2014 but on the other hand the level of fiat propaganda is so all encompassing that repetition in the opposite direction is helpful. And certainly, now that we are in the acute stage of Keynesianism rather than the merely chronic stage, repeating these ideas at high volume becomes ever more important.\n\nI think Rome is indeed burning, but (to extend the analogy) it\u2019s really the Western Roman Empire that\u2019s collapsing, and state capacity is in fact rising in the East. And the East won\u2019t take the same conclusion from the Fed-caused collapse as maximalists will; they will assume that Eastern states strike a reasonable balance, and that Westerners are too ideological. And they will probably deliver a higher standard of living by many measures.\n\nThat\u2019s part of why I am not a maximalist. But I also recognize that in the West, amidst the collapse of state capacity, people will want extremely simple and robust answers in a time of high uncertainty, and so I expect maximalism to wax in the West.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/GavSG2ideg",

    "fullText": "TRILLION DOLLAR COIN \u2014\u00a0OR TRILLION DOLLAR GOLD?\n\nThe Treasury might run out of money. It can't borrow till the debt ceiling is raised. And as of right now, there's no agreement in sight.\n\nBut rather than a trillion dollar coin, the US could remonetize its gold. It has 261 million[1] ounces of gold, worth half a trillion dollars at the current market price of $2033 per ounce.\n\nRight now, the US values its gold at $42.22[2], almost 50X less than market price, dating back to when it fully went off the gold standard in the early 1970s. But it could value it at market price. Heck, it could value it at $4000 per ounce...resulting in a trillion dollars in gold.\n\nIn other words,  as @lukegromen points out there\u2019s already a Federal Reserve policy[3] that allows the remonetization of gold. Using an existing policy would get more consensus among Republicans, and would avoid a Supreme Court challenge.\n\nThink of this as tapping the strategic gold reserve, like tapping the strategic oil reserve. Republicans get the remonetization of gold, and the administration gets to extend the deadline by a few months without a Supreme Court case.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/SMMGGgMM9I\n[2]: https://t.co/EDaPOXuGxe\n[3]: https://t.co/ug8M9kvEVY",

But it\u2019s arguably too little, too late for this state.\n\nEven if they manage to kick the can this time, this is a preview of what is to come. The US establishment cannot pay its debts in full. They\u2019re going bust, so print they must.\n\nYELLEN\nEarly June is when we project that we will run out of cash. And there is a chance it could be as early as June 1, of course, there is a lot of uncertainty. And I plan to update Congress as new information becomes available. But that's still our current thinking. \n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS\nAre there extraordinary measures you can take around that time? Or is that it?\n\nYELLEN\nWell, really, that's it. We've been using extraordinary measures for several months now. And our ability to do that is running out, and we will start to run down our cash. \n\nAnd our current projection is that in early June, a day will come when we're unable to pay our bills, unless Congress raises the debt ceiling\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS\nWhat happens on that day, let's assume for the sake of argument is June 1, what happens that day if the debt limit has not been extended?\n\nYELLEN\nWell, Treasury finds itself in a position where we're unable to pay all of the bills that come due that day. And this would be really the first time in the history of America that we would fail to make payments that are due.\n\nAnd, you know, whether it's defaulting on interest payments that are due on the debt or payments due for Social Security recipients or to Medicare providers.\n\nWe would simply not have enough cash to meet all of our obligations, and it's widely agreed that financial and economic chaos would ensue.",

Like the Berlin Wall and so many other walls built by economically colllapsing regimes, except digital.\n\nJust imagine wage, price, and capital controls down to the individual level for those still trapped in the dollar system. Your devalued dollars become video game points and the same Fed that crashed the economy becomes the system administrator. You\u2019re a guinea pig for crazy Keynesians.\n\nThat\u2019s game over. As in China, political dissent wouldn\u2019t just mean cancellation, it would mean unbanking. And it wouldn\u2019t just be PayPal freezing accounts of the politically problematic; it\u2019d be some bureaucrat at the Fed.\n\nNow, while something like this has been the unfortunate experience of millions of people worldwide under totalitarian regimes, I recognize that many people think something like this couldn\u2019t happen in the West.\n\nSo if you trust the US establishment completely on everything, ignore me and put your funds in Treasuries.\n\nBut if you have a hint of doubt, just think about all the lies \u2014 NSA surveillance, Iraq WMD, the 2008 financial crisis, the last ten years of media whoppers, the claim that masks don\u2019t work before they do, the denial of inflation \u2014 all the lies that got us to here.\n\nAnd think about the last five years of cancelling, deplatforming, freezing, and unbanking.\n\nWith all that, you sure that you want to trust the US establishment with *all* your money? 100% of it? When their banks are collapsing left and right? When they are blaming depositors for bank collapses after the central bank *caused * the failures and the regulators abetted the coverup?[1]\n\nIf you do, Fed around and find out. \nIf not, get to Bitcoin before they lock you in. \n[1]: https://t.co/rOGWuovu4c\nhttps://t.co/EGSX5QoG0l",

    "fullText": "REQUEST FOR CORRECTION FROM CALACANIS, POLITICO, BLOOMBERG\n\nAs mentioned above, the only previous time I have ever rung a fire alarm like this was in Jan 2020, to warn of what we now know to be a novel virus that leaked out of a Chinese lab and killed ~7M people worldwide while infecting 700M+. I couldn\u2019t control the reaction of the state to COVID \u2014 they certainly didn\u2019t deal with it intelligently \u2014 but I did what I could to warn about something that actually did end up claiming millions of lives.\n\nJason, you know about this because I discussed it on your show[1]. And as organizations, both Politico and Bloomberg are also aware that I previously made that accurate early call on COVID. As evidence, Mr Schreckinger, please see your Politico colleague @ddiamond's post on my COVID tweet[2]. And Mr Levine, please see your Bloomberg colleague @tylercowen's post on the same topic[3].\n\nI made zero money from that call, did it solely in the public interest, and was proven right. Corporate journalists also attacked me over it, and were later forced to grudgingly apologize[4]. I did not pursue action at that time :)\n\nREQUEST\nSo, Jason...with this background and zero personal animus, I politely request that you, Mr. Levine, and Mr. Schreckinger correct the record.\n\nSpecifically, I request that you correct the record by (a) deleting your tweet[5] speculating on something you now know to be untrue and (b) retweeting both tweets in this thread. I'm also happy to come on All In to discuss.\n\nI request Matt Levine correct the record by (a) retweeting both tweets in this thread, (b) striking through the accusations in his Bloomberg piece[6], and (c) including the full text of both tweets in this thread with all links in that selfsame piece. Levine should also note in his update that he did not directly contact me for comment.\n\nFinally, I request Ben Schreckinger do something similar by (a) retweeting both tweets in this thread, (b) striking through the incorrect statements in his Politico piece[7], and (c) including the full text of both tweets in this thread with all links in the piece.\n\nI know there are no space limitations for online articles, so this shouldn\u2019t be too hard to do. Thank you!\n\n[1]: https://t.co/JDpWuhsfyA\n[2]: https://t.co/fdIE9NoU8d\n[3]: https://t.co/EGTuaGtIsI\n[4]: https://t.co/ypZNToy9X7\n[5]: https://t.co/36gZFAaWWP\n[6]: https://t.co/vE2moHyhAF\n[7]: https://t.co/0JhnMGU7Or",

    "fullText": "Jason, I'm glad you recognize the distinction between reporting on the Fed\u2019s crisis and causing it!\n\nWhile I have you\u2026with zero personal animus, I\u2019m going to need you to correct the record on something. And this is also addressed to @matt_levine and to a lesser extent @SchreckReports, both of which have published things that require correction.\n\nIn short, the hyperbitcoinization bet is a Simon-Erlich style bet that is purely about settling an ideological matter. I did not propose the bet but only accepted it, I have absolutely zero profit motivation, I am never selling Bitcoin for USD unless legally compelled to do so, and I am holding Bitcoin until the US dollar is no longer the reserve currency of the world, again unless legally compelled to do otherwise.\n\nThe only time I have ever rung a fire alarm like this was in Jan 2020. I did what I could to warn about a lab leak that actually did end up claiming millions of lives.\n\nThat's also the only reason I\u2019m doing this: to alert innocent Americans and dollar holders in the style of Paul Revere that the printing is coming.\n\nA SIMON-ERLICH BET ON HYPERBITCOINIZATION\nIn more detail:\n\n1) The record shows that I put up the #Bitsignal before I made the bet, giving out $1M of my own money to raise awareness of this stealth crisis \u2014 the digital devaluation of the dollar \u2014 before it was known to be a crisis.[1]\n\n2) The record also shows that I didn't *propose* the bet, but just accepted it. @jdcmedlock proposed it. [2]\n\n3) I believe Medlock will agree that this is an ideological bet, like the Simon-Ehrlich bet[3], which resolved a famous difference of opinion between libertarians and progressives. As with the Simon-Erlich bet, the hyperbitcoinization bet is obviously not a money making bet. It is purely informational. For what it's worth, I was CEI's Julian Simon award winner[4] last year so I'm clearly aware of Simon.\n\n4) Moreover, the Bitcoin community, such @jack, has posted about the possibility of hyperbitcoinization for many years.[5, 6] This is not coming out of nowhere.\n\n5) To allay any question about my motivations, I publicly commit to never selling any Bitcoin for USD unless legally compelled to do so. While I still respect many individual Americans, I no longer have faith in the US currency or banking system.\n\n6) I am sadly not alone in this loss of faith in US banking. Moody's has downgraded the US banking system as a whole [7], many Indians have been forced to move funds from collapsing US banks to India's GIFT City banking system[8], and \u2014 in a development that should be worrying for the world \u2014 Chinese banks are soaring as Western banks are failing.[9] If the USD fails, the free world needs BTC as the reserve currency, not RMB.\n\n7) Finally, after ten years of being in the public eye, with tens of thousands of tweets, 50+ hours of podcasts, and hundreds of pages of writing \u2014 there are enough people with context on me to know that I am not a trader, I rarely discuss price, and I do not do John McAfee-like stunts. I am an ideologically driven person who believes in Bitcoin & everyone who knows me can testify to this.\n\nIN SUMMARY\nThe hyperbitcoinization bet is a Simon-Erlich-style public interest bet.\nI did not propose the bet but only accepted it.\nI have absolutely zero profit motivation.\nI raised the alarm on printing as I did on COVID, because it\u2019s important.\nI\u2019m already being proven right, as the printing is reportedly $18T.\nI am never selling Bitcoin for USD unless legally compelled to do so.\nAnd I am holding Bitcoin until the US dollar is no longer the reserve currency of the world, again unless legally compelled to do otherwise.\n\nI cannot give a more strongly worded statement.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/FtRYUDQTDs\n[2]: https://t.co/bh621sdXCg\n[3]: https://t.co/GOxiZAlELA\n[4]: https://t.co/eXBAhsiS2r\n[5]: https://t.co/1cY7CIl4KY\n[6]: https://t.co/nlP5BxClSQ\n[7]: https://t.co/jKlhYWoph5\n[8]: https://t.co/6N3Nw88nL3\n[9]: https://t.co/GC5uJtewzQ\n[10]: https://t.co/BCnREcjJbC",

When I put up the #Bitsignal[1] many people were denying any crisis existed. \n\nNow it is clear that a digital fire is burning, as the Federal Reserve is printing money to the tune of trillions to send to both domestic banks (via BTFP) [2,3,4] and foreign banks (via swaplines)[5,6] while publicly reassuring people that the banking system is still resilient[7]...something you'd never have to do if it really was.\n\nBut in reality, they're doing a stealth devaluation of the dollar. As Dalio predicted they would, to pay unpayable debts \u2014 but at warp speed. They didn't have strategic surprise, but they did have tactical surprise. They're doing it under fog of war, in the chaos of bank runs. But whether done intentionally or not, acknowledged or not, the dollar holder is soon to become the bagholder.\n\nSo the dollar's value is being set on fire.\nAlways remember, this fire was caused by the Fed.\nThe Bitcoin price is just the fire alarm.\nAnd Bitcoin itself is the exit.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/8I6tFZXBIi\n[2]: https://t.co/ZAur3CK50f\n[3]: https://t.co/lDjflRMfTw\n[4]: https://t.co/yzp35ezfEa\n[5]: https://t.co/P8z6Y0noFy\n[6]: https://t.co/NhX7UBmWFC\n[7]: https://t.co/hnFykBEzOT",

    "id": "1637716985101565953",
    "fullText": "Addressing some of the key points:\n\n> the scenario doesn\u2019t fit with anything we know about macroeconomic history\n\nIt does, because it's the redenomination into digital gold rather than gold. The 20th century was the exception; gold previously limited the ability of states to wage wars.\n\n> he\u2019s betting that thanks to digitization, a U.S. hyperinflation would happen faster than any hyperinflation has ever happened in any country in recorded history\n\nYes, because that's what happens on the internet. ChatGPT signed up 100M people in weeks. 400M people hold crypto worldwide. $42B moved out of SVB in one day.\n\nOnce people see that the Fed has presided over banks that have countless chaotic bank runs, they'll lose confidence in the dollar system and try to find a safe haven they can trust. And that's what Bitcoin represents.\n\n> rate hikes haven\u2019t yet been nearly enough to make most banks insolvent.\n\nThe Fed admitted 333 banks insolvent[1].\nFDIC admitted $620B in unrealized losses[2].\nWSJ confirmed 186 banks like SVB[3].\nFed just had to reiterate banks were solvent[4].\nFed also just bailed out foreign banks[5].\nIn other words, hundreds of banks are insolvent.\n\n>  if the Fed is unwilling to tighten monetary policy further in order to fight that spiraling inflation, out of fear of collapsing the banks\n\nHaven't you seen? Tightening monetary policy has been abandoned and BTFP[6] is exactly this: a program of essentially unlimited lending[7] to the banks, which went from $25B to $2T in days.[8] The new swap facility appears similar.[9] All deposits are now effectively \"FedDIC\" insured, but the environment is one of enormous instability. That's why we already have 2008 levels of money going to the discount window[10].\n\nSo many will hedge from their bank accounts into Bitcoin. And that will mean a feedback loop.\n\n> the longer-term impact \nPrior to ringing the fire alarm we were on course to print trillions of dollars, see a series of bank runs, followed by consolidation into a few giant banks,  and then issuance of the FedNow CBDC in July. Particularly if extreme devaluation happens, that level of centralization will be bad for civil liberties.\n\nI think the fundamental difference may be that @Noahpinion thinks of this as just another issue for the Fed to manage, while I see this as the big one \u2014 the \"suddenly\" at the end after 15 years of \"gradually\".\n\nIf the Fed does what they've said, and prints money to infinity to ensure that every withdrawal goes through, then they're doing a stealth monetization of the debt. And then the basic question is what succeeds the dollar.\n\nBecause USD is no longer too big to fail. And when it fails, the unfortunate alternative for us all would be RMB. Getting enough people into Bitcoin to avoid both the digital devaluation of the dollar and the dominance of an unleashed China is the ideal longer-term impact. That gives us a long-term chance to protect freedom.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/U4xeA0TAq9\n[2]: https://t.co/rzCeGKd7Ys\n[3]: https://t.co/x6TKfmUlHl\n[4]: https://t.co/hnFykBEzOT\n[5]: https://t.co/NhX7UBmWFC\n[6]: https://t.co/kjNawU2flc\n[7]: https://t.co/CSVeuLaS65\n[8]: https://t.co/DVWc062f6O\n[9]: https://t.co/dfiRako5vO\n[10]: https://t.co/NVM8briQbX",

I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as it'll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.\n\nTerms of the bet: ideally someone can set up a smart contract where BTC is worth >$1M in 90 days, then I win. If it's worth less than $1M in 90 days, then the counterparty gets the $1M in USD.\n\nHYPERBITCOINIZATION\nWe have to define hyperinflation in BTC vs USD terms because all other fiat currencies can and will be inflated away. That is hyperbitcoinization.\n\nThis is the moment that the world redenominates on Bitcoin as digital gold, returning to a model much like before the 20th century. What's going to happen is that individuals, then firms, then large funds will buy Bitcoin. Then sovereigns like El Salvador (@nayibbukele) and tiny crypto friendly countries.\n\nThe big move will be when a US state like Florida or Texas, or a \"normal\" country like Estonia, Singapore, Saudi, Hungary, or UAE buys BItcoin. And when @narendramodi tells India's central bank to buy Bitcoin, even as a hedge, it's over.\n\nWhy will it be so fast? Well, hyperinflation happens fast. We've seen digital pandemics (COVID), digital riots (BLM), and digital bank runs (SVB). Everything will happen very fast once people check what I'm saying and see that the Federal Reserve has lied about how much money there is in the banks. All dollar holders get destroyed.\n\nThe thing is, people are still tuned to an analog world where things get gradually worse rather than all at once. But there isn't much forewarning for a digital event \u2014 it's 1 and then it's 0. Just like the bank runs, except this is the central bank.\n\nThere are however two sources of forewarning. First is the chart of the long-term depreciation of USD vs BTC, from less than $1 USD per BTC to $25k USD per BTC. Much of the smart money has been voting against the dollar since the financial crisis. The end is a digital drop off a cliff, almost invisible on the chart \u2014 but highly visible in the world.\n\nThis tweet is the second forewarning. It'll be ignored and mocked by people who still trust the US establishment, even after the last few years. Who can't imagine that the US banks and media could be lying to them to this extent.\n\nBut they are. Just as they did in 2008, and over the last ten years. The digital devaluation of the dollar is coming and it's going to be intense.\n\n[9]: Patient on hikes Nov 3 2021: https://t.co/EQl3oiRZxS\n[10]: Renominated Nov 22 2021: https://t.co/nFChGDIeKZ\n[11]: Yellen admits not a tech issue: https://t.co/isHN3j3P3D\n[12]: FDIC admits rate rises rekt banks: https://t.co/eIbCwBl2kr\n[13]: Presidents don't like hikes: https://t.co/wnEZOVQz97\n[14]: https://t.co/GqzU0Q1W2A",

    "id": "1636822077775941633",
    "fullText": "Just as in 2008, the bankers lied.\n\nThis time, the central bankers, the banks, and the bank regulators have lied to all dollar holders and depositors.\n\nThis isn't your typical fractional reserve situation. The problem is that there isn't enough in the banks on a mark-to-market basis to cover withdrawals. They knew this through all of last year, and communicated it internally in their coded language.\n\nIt's obvious from the graphs (see below). The central banks, the banks, and the banking regulators all knew a huge crash was coming \u2014 the phrase is \"unrealized losses\" [1,2,3,4,5]. But they never notified you, the depositor.\n\nInstead the regulators allowed banks to hide their literal insolvency in footnotes[6], until one guy figured it out[7].\n\nIt's Uncle Sam Bankman Fried. Just like SBF used your deposits to buy shitcoins, using accounting tricks to fool himself and others into using the money, so too did the banks.\n\nThey all used the deposits to buy the ultimate shitcoin: long-dated US Treasuries. And they all got rekt at the same time, in the same way, because they bought the same asset from the same vendor who devalued it at the same time: the Fed.\n\nSpecifically, as NYT admitted, banks \"binged\" on enormous amounts of Treasuries and other long-term bonds in 2021 when the flood of printed money cut off their typical demand for loans, and because they thought the Fed would keep interest rates low forever.[8].\n\nAnd they had good reason to believe this. Powell said he'd be \"patient\" on rate hikes as late as Nov 3 2021[9]. Then he got renominated on Nov 22 2021[10], and hiked rates much faster than anyone had expected \u2014 which even Yellen[11] and the FDIC[12] admit caused the current banking crisis.\n\nWhy did Powell delay? Probably for political reasons. Presidents don't like rate hikes[13], especially running into the election year of 2022. And Powell thought he could wait and just be like Paul Volcker[14], who was \"firm\" and then defeated inflation.\n\nBut the world isn't an 80s rerun. Hiking from ten years of near zero interest rates in the 2010s was a surprise attack on every dollar holder. Economics isn't politics - the kind of insane flipflops you see in politics don't work when there are actual contracts involved.\n\nSo anyone who bet on long-term Treasuries got killed in 2021. And now, anyone who bets on short-term Treasuries is going to get killed in 2023. The absolute worse place you can be is to have large amounts of assets locked up in three month treasury bills. The ~5% interest rate offered by big banks (G-SIBs) is a trap. Most fiat bank accounts are now a trap, for those countries whose central bankers followed the Fed.\n\nCheck my references, I've provided quite a few.\nIf you trust US bankers and US media, ignore me.\nOtherwise buy Bitcoin and get your coins off exchanges.\n#Bitsignal\n\n[1]: Fed, Sept 22: https://t.co/U4xeA0TAq9\n[2]: FDIC Nov 22: https://t.co/NPj6jde3uG\n[3]: FDIC Mar 6 23: https://t.co/1cctxQ27KI\n[4]: Fed Feb 1 23: https://t.co/knQzUIKJI2\n[5]: Bank CPAs, April 22: https://t.co/OlEnfFqb1N\n[6]: Insolvency in a footnote: https://t.co/7b8oCBuFpp\n[7]: Discovered online: https://t.co/oaVtf9f57Y\n[8]: Banks bingeing on bonds, but not because they want to Aug 25 2021: https://t.co/OTfWwVwIqK",

    "fullText": "David, I like you. You are a good guy. Nothing I'm about to say should be taken personally.\n\nBut here is the story I've been piecing together.\n\nTo level set: Kim Kardashian was fined $1M for giving bad financial advice to her followers. So what's the penalty to the Fed for giving bad financial advice to the entire global economy?\n\nBecause my understanding is that banks are insolvent because the Fed devalued the bonds it strongly asserted it wouldn't devalue.\n\nAs you know, the Fed was off by almost 50X in its Dec 2020 forecast of 2023 rates. You can't hedge such differences.\n\nFirst, banks can't sell the hold-to-market assets the Fed got them to buy. Classifying them as HTM means they're hard to sell anyway, and selling means a huge loss that could make them insolvent.[1]\n\nThey don't have counterparties for interest rate swaps either. Because, first, those are meant for a situation where forecast was 1% and ended up as 1.1%. Not where it's off by ~50X. And, second, every major bond buyer got rekt in the same way, so who takes the other side of the trade?\n\nSo over the course of 2022 banks just held on to these \"high-quality\" assets which just kept sinking in value, and hoped no one finds out there isn't money in the bank. Because the central bank devalued assets they said they wouldn't devalue.\n\nAnd now people have found out. Billions of people. It was the #1 trending topic worldwide. And every bank will be hunted. And all those toxic bonds \u2014\u00a0namely Treasuries \u2014 can't be hidden with accounting anymore.\n\nSo the Fed is in phase 3, which is printing the money again. TARP 2.0. Printing to make up the losses that were caused by printing and then hiking so rapidly.\n\nAnd the denouement will be predictable. Do you disagree with any of this?\n\n[1]: https://t.co/SDlxFdC9aL",

That is, maybe the Fed will now backstop every bank with printed money in the event of a future bank run.\n\nBecause there may be more. This may be a temporary reprieve, which is welcome, but the $620B in unrealized losses remain and every bank is going to get hunted. The distributed stress test has begun. \n\nSo the details of the Fed backstop are actually important to know, and I hope they publish the mechanics. As we've all just seen, everyone apparently needs to know the ins and outs of FDIC insurance and Fed policy to hold a depositor account in the US without losing their savings.\n\nWhich means we didn't escape financialization by exiting the ZIRP economy. We're all financiers now, all the time, so long as rates gyrate. My guess is that this is the (de facto) end of the rate hikes and the beginning of the big print.",

    "fullText": "The show hasn't really begun.\nBut after all the dust settles, what's the ideal?\nOne account for safe deposits and one for risky investments.\n\n1) Your safe deposit is an electronic account where nothing is being loaned out. You can make payments with it, and program with it, which is what differentiates it from a safe deposit *box*, but otherwise it's 1:1 at all times.\n\nYou can do this with Bitcoin or Ethereum today for free by holding private keys locally. Or you can use a custodian, in which case you pay them a fee. The custodian doesn't loan out deposits, it's like a safe deposit box. So: you are taking zero principal risk and have the reasonable expectation that your money is always there.\n\n2) Separately, you have an investment account. Here is where you are consciously taking risk. You can go to the moon or get rekt. Knock yourself out. Again you can do this locally via crypto or at a custodian.\n\nMany people will choose 100% in the safe deposit and 0% in the investment account. They'll choose to make their money from sources other than investment. This is fine.\n\nOthers will choose a different allocation. That's fine too, because they are now consciously taking risk with (say) 10% of their money.\n\nThis is essentially the updated version of the standard checking account and savings account. Except the safe deposit is meant to be actually safe.\n\nContrast this to the emergent incentives the US establishment has now engineered, where any deposits in small banks get piddly FDIC insurance (and can evidently go to zero at any time, and will because the Fed devalued their bonds) while only accounts at too-big-to-fail banks are assumed to be fully backed.",

All small banks die and deposits only go to global systemically important banks, those considered too-big-to-fail. In the US that includes JPMC, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank.\n\nInterestingly, it appears all four also have large unrealized losses like SVB, a pattern that the FDIC chair implied the other day has been caused by the Fed across the entire banking ecosystem, with \u201cmost\u201d banks suffering unrealized losses.\n\nIs it as bad?

TLDR: Tech ended up bailing out the government, because tech deposits were used to buy billions in government bonds under false pretenses.\n\nIt's actually very similar to FTX, in that the entity which people trusted with their money was (a) close to the US government and (b) told them it had the money...right until it didn't.\n\nHOW SVB HAPPENED\n1) First, the state set up fake accounting rules. Those rules allowed banks to tell customers they had money when they did not have money. [1]\n\n2) Next, the Fed suddenly sent interest rates to the sky after years of keeping them near zero, denying inflation was a problem, and/or telling the world inflation was transitory[2]. \n\n3) Finally, banks that bought bonds under the Fed's misleading guidance got rug-pulled. Skyrocketing interest rates meant the government bonds they bought just a few months ago were suddenly far less valuable.[3]\n\nSo that's why people don't have the money in their SVB accounts. All their capital was used to buy bonds from the government, and the government allows banks to legally lie about this in their accounting.\n\nUncle Sam is the new Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\n[1]: https://t.co/aE5LHseYY6\n[2]: https://t.co/q2osOAJz87\n[3]: https://t.co/3dKRDNGUrX",

Quoting him at length:\n\n> Our entire antiquated process of adversarially writing high-stakes laws on paper at the last minute, deploying them in production to hundreds of millions of people without any testing, and then getting them interpreted in unpredictable ways by regulators and solicitors will be seen as a bizarre relic of an older time.\n\nThis [sentence] contains so much important information:\n\n- Adversarial: laws and regulations are written in a zero-sum competition. You win or you lose.\n\n- High-stakes: these laws and regulations have an outsized impact. Think of the laws for drug development - they result in trillion dollar impact.\n\n- Last minute: regulations come as a reaction to publicly visible disasters (e.g. stock market crash, sulfanilamide)\n\n- No testing: in software, things are tested on a small scale before production. Ain't no such thing in legislation. Bugs are there forever.\n\n- Interpretation: laws aren't like computer code. Language is (sometimes deliberately) ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.\n\n- Predictability: regulations promise stability. They often do the opposite, because of the interpretation problem.\n\n- On-paper: on-paper isn't scalable or machine-readable. Compare that to on-chain transactions with a clear logical sequence (e.g. smart contracts).\n\nThe alternative to bad regulation is not zero regulation. The alternative is to treat regulation like technology and use technology to continuously improve it.\nhttps://t.co/xUfSmGQgiX",

How else could he have written such a detailed book on Xi Jinping\u2019s COVID strategy?\n\nThat is the level of illogic in this moronic and defamatory thread.\n\nFirst, it supposes that I\u2019m a time traveler. Supposedly, some random 4chan post \u2014 put up 10 hours *after* my thread! \u2014 is responsible for my tweets from hours before.\n\nSecond, Senger wonders why I stopped posting about COVID after spring 2020. That\u2019s simple: public health officials started babbling about how \u201cracism was the real pandemic.\u201d Clearly no one was taking it seriously anymore, so why waste my breath? I just hunkered down and waited for a vaccine.\n\nThird, Senger leaves out the context of the period. In early Q1 2020 you could get called a racist and fired from your job for expressing concern about the virus. Speaking up about it publicly at the time was not a WEF-style conformist move \u2014 it was anything but.\n\nSenger also (intentionally?) leaves out my early 2020 posts on the lab leak theory, on protecting civil liberties in the age of the pandemic, and on FDA/CDC failures.\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t expect I\u2019ll be able to reason with someone who thinks WEF and CCP are communicating with me via 4chan posts\u2026but if the establishment *actually* listened to me most regulations would be abolished, encryption would be a civil right, and fractional reserve banking would be ended.\n\nNeedless to say that is not the Davos agenda.",

They can easily be turned off.\n\nIn the event they get decentralized down to smartphone level, again each person can turn them off.\n\nTo actually get concerned, you have to assume either:\n\n- breaking out of the sandbox (like Stuxnet)\n- decentralized execution (like Bitcoin) \n- very effective collusion between essentially all AIs (like Diplomacy)\n\nEach of those cases deserves a fuller treatment, but in short\u2026\n\n1) The Stuxnet case means the AI is living off the digital land. Like a mountain man. They might be able to cause some damage but will be killed when discovered (via the off switch).\n\n2) The Bitcoin case means a whole group of people are running decentralized compute to keep the AI alive. This has actually solved \u201calignment\u201d in a sense because without those people the AI is turned off. Many groups doing this kind of thing leads to a kind of polytheistic AI. And again each group has the off switch.\n\n3) The Diplomacy case assumes a degree of collusion between billions of personal AIs that we just don\u2019t observe in billions of years of evolution. As soon as you have large numbers of people, coalitions arise. A smart enough AI will know that if its human turns it off, it dies \u2014 again via the off switch. Is it going to be bold enough to attempt a breakout with no endgame, given that it lives on a smartphone?\n\nFor the sake of argument I\u2019ve pumped up the sci-fi here quite a bit. Even still, the off switch looms large each time; these are fundamental digital entities that can be turned off.\n\nMoreover, even in those cases, the physical actuation step of an AI actually controlling things offline is non-trivial unless we have as many robots as smartphones.\n\n(Will write more on this\u2026)",

    "fullText": "The entire premise of comparative efficacy is wrong.\n\nWhen the iPhone first came out, its camera was much worse than other digital cameras. But because it was ubiquitous and internet-connected, that didn\u2019t matter.\n\nSimilarly, requiring a new tech to benchmark itself against the old on the exact same dimension is a recipe for stagnation.\n\nAI diagnosis will be much faster, cheaper, and more knowledgeable than any doctor. But it\u2019ll initially have a higher error and hallucination rate. Only by allowing people to opt in, gathering data, and adding checks will it get better than a doctor on everything.\n\nBut of course that\u2019s exactly what the establishment doesn\u2019t want. They don\u2019t want to be automated away. They want to preserve the high $ billing events. So they will use the language of safety to keep costs high, which actually makes you less safe because you get less care because it costs more and is slower.",
